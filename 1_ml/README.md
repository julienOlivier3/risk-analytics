# Machine Learning in Risk and Finance

## Course Overview

The **Machine Learning in Risk and Finance** course aims to provide participants with practical skills in applying Machine Learning (ML) to quantitative risk management. This hands-on seminar covers various methods and use cases relevant to professionals in the Risk and Finance sectors.

## Key Learning Objectives

Participants will learn essential ML concepts and algorithms, including:
- **ML pipelines**
- **Tree-based ML algorithms** (e.g., Regression Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)
- **Model training and inference**

The course emphasizes a systematic approach to modeling risks and predicting uncertain outcomes, utilizing popular Python libraries like **scikit-learn** and **pandas**.

## Practical Application

A specific use case explored in the course involves assessing the resale value of leased cars at the end of their lease terms, a common risk for car leasing companies. The goal is to demonstrate how ML can enhance the quantitative assessment of risks faced by organizations operating under uncertainty.
