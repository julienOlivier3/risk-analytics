    "In this part of the course we will develop a conversational AI that provides seamless information about risks and challenges faced by publicly listed companies based on their annual reports. More precisely we will develop an application where a Large Language Model (LLM) orchestrates user queries to the annual reports that are relevant for the query. The user's query will then be enriched with information from the relevant reports which allows the LLM to come up with answers that closely reflect the information from the reports. In other words, the generated answers from the LLM are tuned by a retrieval mechanism that adds domain knowledge to the LLM's response which it otherwise would not have from its mere pretraining. This mechanism is called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and is a quite popular approach when developing conversational GenAI applications."

    "- Financial Analysts and Investment Professionals such as portfolio managers, equity analysts, and hedge fund managers, need to assess the risks and challenges of companies to make informed investment decisions. A risk agent could help them quickly analyze risk disclosures in annual reports, saving time and improving accuracy.\n",
    "- Corporate Risk Managers need to benchmark their own risk disclosures against competitors or industry standards. A risk agent could help them identify trends in risk reporting and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.\n",
    "- ESG analysts focus on evaluating companies' sustainability and governance practices. Risk disclosures in annual reports often include information about environmental and social risks, which are critical for ESG assessments. A risk agent could help them extracting and analyzing ESG-related risks from annual reports to evaluate a company's sustainability profile."

The data reported for the 2020 benchmark year \\ndata was collected from 2021-2023, the 2023 mid-term year data will be collected in 2024, and the \\n2025 data will be collected in 2026. In 2023, we completed the 2020 benchmarking by collecting wage \\ndata in China, Thailand, and Pakistan.22 In line with the benchmarking completed in Cambodia, \\nIndonesia, and Vietnam in the previous year, we compared factory wage data to external benchmarks, \\nsuch as the applicable legal minimum wage, the FLA Country Average, which is an industry average \\nbased on suppliers working with FLA member companies, and the Global Living Wage Coalition \\n(‘GLWC’) benchmark, where available.  \\nResults of our entire benchmarking period 2020 show that the wages paid by the suppliers in scope for this \\nexercise (representing around 80% of all strategic suppliers) exceed all of the aforementioned \\nbenchmarks. In line with the FLA Fair Compensation formula, all wages reported below include regular \\nwages, paid leave, applicable and eligible incentives, benefits in kind and cash benefits, and exclude all \\nlegally required taxes and social insurance contributions. \\n─ Cambodia (ten factories): In our major sourcing country for apparel, wages paid by adidas \\nsuppliers surpassed the legal gross minimum wage by 56% and the applicable net FLA Country \\nAverage by 33%. In the case of Cambodia, 90% of the factories assessed are unionized, while 10% \\nhave a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in place. \\n─ China (14 factories): The factories assessed in China are located within ten different gross \\nminimum wage groups. Across all minimum wage groups, factories’ net wages surpassed their \\napplicable minimum wage requirement by between 13% and 159%. Currently, two of our data \\ncollection in-scope factories with an available and applicable GLWC benchmark surpassed their \\nGLWC benchmark by 2% and 34%, respectively. In China, 79% of these factories have a state-\\nbacked trade union, and 43% a CBA in place.  \\n─ Indonesia (13 factories): The factories assessed in Indonesia are located within ten different legal \\ngross minimum wage groups, which vary widely in terms of minimum wage requirements. Across \\nall minimum wage groups, wages paid surpassed the legal minimum wage by between 9% and \\n66%; 92% of factories are unionized and have a CBA in place. \\n─ Pakistan (two factories): The data shows that wages paid by adidas suppliers surpassed the legal \\ngross minimum wage by 42% and the applicable net FLA Country Average by 16%. Currently, \\nnone of the factories in scope in Pakistan are unionized. \\n─ Thailand (four factories): The factories assessed in Thailand are located within three different \\ngross minimum wage groups. Across all minimum wage groups, wages paid surpassed the legal \\ngross minimum wage by between 36% and 44%. Currently, none of the factories are unionized. \\n  \\n \\n21 Strategic suppliers as of January 2020.  \\n22 Data as reported in the 2022 Annual Report included 2020 benchmarking results from wage data collected in 2021 in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam \\n(approximately 65% of our selected factories are located in these three countries). The reporting in this 2023 Annual Report reflects the full 2020 benchmarking \\nresults from all wage data collected between 2021-2023 from all of our factories in scope for this exercise located in our three initial countries (Cambodia, \\nIndonesia, Vietnam), in addition to in-scope factories in China, Pakistan, and Thailand. A small number of factories in four different countries were initially \\nconsidered for data collection and reporting. Due to the minor production volume they represent in their country and to protect their confidentiality, they have \\nbeen subsequently removed from the scope.

These risks and opportunities result, among other things, from its activities that seek to \\ndevelop and make use of opportunities to improve the company’s competitiveness. Risks and \\nopportunities encompass specific events and developments with a certain probability of occurrence \\nthat may have material negative or positive financial and/or non-financial effects on the achievement of \\nthe Beiersdorf Group’s objectives. Beiersdorf uses an integrated risk and opportunity management \\nsystem to identify and evaluate material risks at an early stage and to consistently limit them using \\ncounteractive measures. This system is coordinated at Group headquarters.\\nBeiersdorf Risk Radar\\nSchematic diagram\\nIntegrated risk and opportunity management system\\nThe risk and opportunity management system at Beiersdorf is an integral part of the central and local \\nplanning, management, and control processes in the individual companies, management units, and \\nregions, at Consumer and tesa Business Segment levels, and at Group level. Risk and opportunity \\nmanagement is complemented by the accounting-related internal control systems, the various internal \\nand external monitoring bodies – supported by Internal Audit – and external auditors. Compliance \\nmanagement, which is also relevant in this context, is described extensively in the chapter “Non-\\nfinancial Statement.”\\nRisk and opportunity management is closely aligned with corporate strategy and helps Beiersdorf to \\nidentify its potential and to analyze and make optimal use of this potential while always taking risks into \\naccount. Regularly performing analyses of customers and the competition, for example, enables a swift \\nresponse to dynamic market developments. Specific market opportunities and risks are derived from \\nthe information obtained.\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n156\\nBeiersdorf actively incurs risks only if there is a corresponding opportunity for an appropriate increase \\nin value, and only if they can be managed using established methods and measures within the relevant \\norganization. In cases where the full avoidance of risks is not possible or reasonable, risks are mitigated \\nusing appropriate measures, or are transferred to third parties such as insurance companies.\\nWithin the risk management process, periodic inventories are carried out to identify, evaluate, \\ndocument, and subsequently communicate the material risks in a structured way along with the \\nmeasures to manage these risks. The corresponding principles, reporting and feedback processes, and \\nresponsibilities are laid out in a directive that applies across the Group. This is updated regularly.\\nBeiersdorf Risk Presentation\\nBeiersdorf distinguishes between strategic, functional, and operational risks. Strategic risks encompass \\nfundamental frameworks, developments, and events that could have a substantial impact on the \\nGroup’s business model or its business segments. Functional risks are challenges inherent to the \\nbusiness model. The various specialist functions generally work at the global or regional level to \\ncounter these risks, with sustainable actions relating to the design of operational and organizational \\nstructures as well as with specific individual measures. The opportunities and risks associated with \\nclimate change are also particularly integrated into strategic and functional risk management. \\nOperational risks and opportunities are those that may influence short-term sales and profits of our \\ncorporate affiliates. Appropriate observation periods are assigned to these risk categories.\\nA period of five years generally applies for strategic risks. For functional risks, the period is two years as \\na rule, and for short-term operational risks one year.\\nIn the Group’s internal risk reporting, individual risks are uniformly presented by positioning them on \\nthe Beiersdorf Risk Radar. The various fields of the radar reflect, in summarized form, the relevant areas \\nfor the company both inside and outside the Group that may give rise to risks. The graph on the \\nprevious page (Beiersdorf Risk Radar) shows the structure of the risk radar for strategic risks. By \\ncombining financial, sustainability-related, and legal compliance topics in a single system, the radar has \\nbeen expanded from 8 to 16 topics.\\nFor each category, the risks are also classified based on their probability and the potential financial and \\nnon-financial impact of their occurrence. The likelihood of occurrence and impact of risks are \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n157\\ndetermined on a net basis, assuming that risk-mitigation measures have already been implemented or \\nat least that specific plans for them exist.\\nThe Executive Board and supervisory bodies are regularly updated on the risk situation at Consumer \\nand tesa Business Segment levels and at Group level. Besides this, direct lines of communication ensure \\nthat suddenly occurring material risks are also reported immediately to management. Continuous \\ninformation sharing with the Corporate Development function additionally encourages the \\nconsideration of risk aspects in the support provided to management. Central risk management is also \\nin constant communication with topic-specific task forces, which are created by the Executive Board as \\nnecessary.\\nThe Corporate Risk Board (CRiB), which was newly established in 2022, continued its work in the \\nreporting year and is a key body advising the Executive Board on risk management matters. The CRiB \\ncontinues to consist of the heads of important, mostly globally responsible corporate departments \\ncomprising multiple areas of responsibility (Marketing, Quality Management, Internal Audit, \\nCommunication, Sustainability, Group Accounting, IT Security, Legal). The task of this body is to collate \\nthe various risks – both those already known and those newly identified by the Corporate Risk Board – \\nusing a broad-based approach and to analyze them in depth and present them in summarized form. By \\nbringing together many different perspectives, it provides Beiersdorf with important collective \\nintelligence, further improving and complementing the existing analysis of material risks.\\nAs in the previous year, in analyzing the material risks and opportunities, the Executive Board and \\nSupervisory Board looked at the comparison of the qualitatively and quantitatively aggregated risk \\nportfolio with the updated financial total risk-bearing capacity. The aim was again to determine whether \\nthere was any need for a change in the overall assessment of the risk situation (see below) on this basis.\\nTo ensure maximum transparency and accountability, Beiersdorf’s financial risk-bearing capacity is \\ncalculated based on average net liquidity. The available free cash flow to be used for the development \\nof net liquidity in the multi-period perspective is adjusted solely for the previously deducted \\ninvestments in securities and effects from past M&A transactions. The calculation of risk-bearing \\ncapacity is therefore based on a very conservative approach, as it deliberately does not take into \\naccount potentially significant short-term increases in our liquidity, which could be used in actual crisis \\nsituations.\\nThese increases could include, for example, new and/or increased credit lines, the release of hidden \\nreserves, the sale of fixed assets, individual business units, or own shares from our portfolio, the \\ntemporary suspension of dividend payments, or the reduction of planned investments in the market or \\nin maintaining/expanding our fixed assets. Lastly, for net liquidity and cash flow, we have used only the \\naverage for the last five years, rather than the higher recent figures for 2023.\\nAs a result of comparing the risk situation with risk-bearing capacity, it can be concluded that, over the \\nrelevant observation period of the next two years, the current risk portfolio, revalued during the \\nreporting year, would still not give rise to a financial situation even remotely endangering the Beiersdorf \\nGroup’s continued existence, even given the full and simultaneous occurrence of all the individual risks. \\nDescription of the material risks and opportunities\\nStrategic risks and opportunities\\nAll strategic risks that already existed in 2022 or newly emerged in the 2023 reporting year were again \\nsubjected to a comprehensive review. Where necessary, we adjusted the precise definitions of these \\nrisks and our assessment of their probability and/or impact. This analysis showed no material year-on-\\nyear change in the overall risk situation. Increased risk in some areas, such as climate-related effects \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n158\\nalong the entire value chain, were offset by lower risks in others, for example in relation to the energy \\nsupply situation. In addition, in line with our cautious approach, we have currently completely removed \\nopportunities beyond our medium-term planning from the quantitative net calculation of the risk \\nportfolio. This approach was also taken in the previous year. We have also removed some risk aspects, \\nthat, we regard as part of the day-to-day challenges we continuously face as part of our business model, \\nfrom the definition of strategic risks, since these are generally already captured by our financial \\nplanning. These include, for example, recurring disputes with retailers over pricing, diverse attacks on \\nour brands and products by competitors, and, in particular, the defense of our trademarks and product \\nclaims.\\n1. Reputational risks to brands and the company\\nMaintaining and increasing the value of our major consumer brands with their broad appeal remains \\nof decisive importance to Beiersdorf’s business development. The trust of our customers and, in \\nparticular, of the consumers of our products, is essential to this and cannot be taken for granted. We \\nhave designed our risk management system to fully justify this trust and to provide enduring, \\nsuccessful protection to the value of our brands. We continuously review our internal processes in all \\nareas of the company in order that we can respond appropriately, correctly, and effectively to any \\nevents that could harm or threaten our reputation. Combined with the activities described below in \\nrelation to the quality of our products and overall market image, we expect this to help prevent any \\npotential reputational problems from escalating into critical issues. This applies equally to our \\nbrands and to our company as a whole. Our extensive operational and communication measures in \\nrelation to sustainability, diversity, and other aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) also \\nhelp to limit the risks. In the short term, however, we see a slight increase in net risk as a result of the \\nnew Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, LkSG), despite \\nall the measures already implemented. We categorize the risks to the reputation of our brands and \\nour company as medium and possible overall.\\n2. Critical ingredients\\nFor a clearer distinction and risk assessment, we have presented the risk arising from the use of \\ncritical ingredients separately from general procurement risks in this report. Our research and \\ndevelopment department, with its broad expertise and geographical coverage, ensures that we \\nalways comply with all local legal requirements. It is supported in this by a specialized regulatory \\naffairs function. We are also in permanent dialogue with the relevant authorities so that we can react \\nin good time when changes to product formulation requirements begin to emerge. As a member of \\nthe relevant associations, particularly at the European level, we as a company receive early notice of \\nemerging changes. This also includes our regular dialogue with the key suppliers. In the reporting \\nyear, we made further improvements to our internal process for dealing with critical ingredients. \\nHowever, we note that challenges are growing with the further spread of digital applications and \\nchannels critical of the ingredients used in the cosmetics industry. We continue to categorize the risk \\nas medium and possible. \\n3. Accelerating digitalization\\nThe penetration of digital technology in consumer interaction all along the marketing and sales \\nprocess is still constantly increasing. Beiersdorf therefore continues to work hard at planning and \\nimplementing these interactions in a way that makes them as specific to the target group as \\npossible. We made considerable efforts in precision marketing in 2023, enabling us to invest \\nsignificantly more effectively. At the same time, we put in place organizational measures for even \\nmore integrated working, across all brands, between the functions and IT in close collaboration with \\nthe business. Specifically in e-commerce, we further increased our resourcing to reflect the growing \\nimportance of this channel. Recruiting and retaining suitable talent remains a big challenge. This is \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n159\\nparticularly the case in the field of data analysis, which is crucially important for generating fast and \\naccurate information to guide our actions, including in close dialogue with our customers. Another \\naspect is ensuring the full protection of private data. Our data protection management system, \\nglobally steered and locally implemented, helps us ensure that sensitive data of our company, \\nbusiness partners, and consumers is handled securely at all times. This includes, for example, the \\ndevelopment and use of our social media presence and the development of new software solutions. \\nThese efforts are complemented by clear internal rules of conduct, transparent management \\nstructures, extensive training and monitoring activities, and, in the case of data protection, further \\nwork on global roll-out. In this reporting period, as a result of our various measures, we regard the \\nrisk as medium and possible. \\n4. Growing political and economic uncertainty\\nThe global political situation remained very fraught in the reporting period. Alongside the war in \\nUkraine, the new military conflict in the Middle East is causing uncertainty, as it is unclear whether it \\nwill spread to the wider region. Any such spread could then also have somewhat larger direct \\nimpacts on our business in this region. While the US-China relationship has not deteriorated further \\nin recent months, it continues to represent significant uncertainty. \\nThe outlook for the world economy is difficult to assess overall, since the effects of the very sharp \\ninterest rate hikes of the last 18 months may take some time to be fully reflected in the economic \\nfigures. Highly indebted countries in particular are at high risk if materially higher borrowing costs \\nweigh on current budgets. The same applies to highly indebted individual companies with which \\nBeiersdorf has a direct or indirect business relationship. The real estate crisis in China is potentially a \\nnot-to-be-underestimated factor in this regard. At the same time, Beiersdorf remains geographically \\nrelatively well balanced across all its divisions, without extreme dependency on a particular market. \\nPotential market entries in new countries are comprehensively evaluated in their economic and \\npolitical context. In the case of Russia, care is taken to strictly comply with all sanctions. Nevertheless, \\nwe categorize the risk from the impact of an escalating military conflict or economic crisis in a market \\nrelevant to Beiersdorf as major and possible overall.\\n5. Shortage of raw materials, natural resources, and energy\\nThe general procurement situation has improved in recent months with the easing of COVID-19-\\nrelated restrictions in the global supply chain. This is also evident in falling prices for some important \\nraw materials and packaging materials, even though many categories have not reached the price \\nlevel seen before the pandemic. The same applies to the energy supply, which is regarded as \\nlargely secure at the current time. To allow us to respond swiftly and appropriately to potential \\nfuture supply crises, we are continuously monitoring our markets and suppliers and use appropriate \\ncontract management. Procurement also carefully manages the scope, timing, and frequency of our \\nindividual purchases. Strategic partnerships remain an important element of actively managing our \\nsupplier portfolio, as do internal programs designed to ensure the agility of the supply chain as a \\nwhole and its resilience to disruption. In addition, we are intensively seeking potential cost \\nreductions throughout the value chain as part of the continuation of our broad-based value \\nengineering project. While we see overall positive trends, this area remains one of significant \\nuncertainty. Therefore, we regard the strategic and functional risks in relation to availability and \\nprice trends on the procurement side as medium and possible given the volatile environment.\\n6. Cybersecurity\\nAs part of the review of our strategic risks, we have now returned to reporting the risk from threats to \\nour IT system and the IT systems of our direct business partners as a specific individual risk. This \\nreflects the special and further increasing significance of this risk. This year, the risk of physical \\nunavailability of critical infrastructure excluding IT (chiefly production and storage centers, including \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n160\\ntransport) has been allocated to risks from climate change. With regard to cybersecurity, we \\nsuccessfully defended ourselves again in 2023 against direct and indirect attacks on our own IT \\nsystems. We achieved further improvements in IT infrastructure, particularly in cloud services. We \\nused technical and training-based measures to reduce the particular risk arising from increased \\nworking from home. We also repeated our ISO 27001 certification as an important independent \\nconfirmation of our efforts. In addition, we began to even better protect our operational systems \\nalong the value chain. In light of the growing overall number of threats, we categorize the risk as \\nmedium and possible, despite all the progress achieved.\\n7. Growing ESG requirements\\nRegulatory requirements in this area are constantly increasing. This is due particularly to the \\nEuropean Green Deal, which is implemented through national law, and to the \\nLieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, LkSG). Irrespective of \\nlegal requirements, Beiersdorf has been setting very high goals. This is evident from our own \\nspecific sustainability targets in relation to packaging reduction and avoidance, as well as climate \\nprotection. We are continuing to follow through on implementing our new plastics cycle strategy, \\nfirst announced in 2021, along with our efforts to develop and use sustainable packaging and \\napplications. We have continuously increased our ability to transparently measure progress against \\ninterim targets. In 2023, we again held various events in different formats that were designed to help \\nimprove the awareness and understanding of our employees and managers around the topics of \\nthe environment and sustainability. We also organized a global diversity and inclusion week in 2023 \\nto share our progress and announce ambitious new targets, for example in relation to people with \\ndisabilities. To meet the requirements of the new LkSG, we held training programs primarily on \\naspects related to human rights, both internally and for our suppliers. At the same time, we began \\nassessing and auditing suppliers in relation to this legislation. Given their large number, it will take \\nan extended period of time for this process to cover all our business partners. We anticipate that \\nexpectations on the part of the public, NGOs, and our customers will continue to grow in relation to \\nboth our environmental protection efforts and our actions as a responsible corporate citizen. We \\ntherefore still categorize this risk as major and possible. \\n8. Climate change-related effects along the value chain\\nIn this new risk category, we include all the possible impacts of climate change on our entire value \\nchain – from procuring crucial raw materials and packaging to transporting products to end \\ncustomers. In 2023, we arranged for an extensive external study on risk trends at our own locations \\nbetween now and 2040. The resulting insights are now being translated into appropriate packages \\nof measures. We have also begun to set up continuous monitoring of these risks, including for \\ncritical ingredients. Particular attention is being paid to the water supply at our production sites. We \\nare also constantly updating our emergency plans for critical infrastructure and supplies so that we \\ncan swiftly and fully respond to such situations. At the current time, we categorize this risk as \\nmedium and possible.\\n9. Shortage of talent and skills\\nAnother risk, which we are now upgrading from a functional risk to a strategic risk, relates to the \\ngrowing challenge of recruiting and retaining suitable talent and providing all of our individuals with \\nappropriately swift and comprehensive training on new technologies. This risk affects both our \\nGerman locations and our national companies, particularly in relation to all activities with a strong \\ndigital component. Beiersdorf is competing here not only with other players in our industry but also \\nespecially also with technology firms both large and small. As our most important measure, we \\ntherefore worked urgently in the reporting year on a new employer branding program, which we \\nwill shortly roll out worldwide. We have also stepped up our presence on social media, including by \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n161\\ninvolving all senior managers in our external communications, so as to raise Beiersdorf’s profile and \\nincrease awareness of us as an attractive employer. Partnerships and contacts with universities also \\nserve to build links with qualified potential new employees so that we can prepare them for a career \\nat Beiersdorf through special trainee programs. As in previous years, we reviewed our employees’ \\nsatisfaction using an external, standardized, and anonymous survey, comparing the results both to \\nour own track record and the wider market. The results showed a further slight improvement on the \\nprevious year’s very high satisfaction level. The even greater focus internally on regular, high-quality \\npersonal development meetings and measures should have contributed to this. We have launched \\ntraining programs to tailor employees’ skills to the constantly growing requirements, particularly in \\nrelation to digital technology. These cover general and function-specific skills for which our various \\nacademies are responsible. Given our current competitive strength, we currently assess this risk to \\nbe low and possible.\\n10. Generative artificial intelligence\\nWe have listed this risk, which also represents an incredible opportunity, separately from the risk of \\ngeneral digital acceleration in order to reflect the very rapid pace of developments in this area. As a \\nbrand owner, Beiersdorf is also exposed to particular challenges here. We distinguish between two \\ntypes of risks: firstly, risks arising from the feeding of data to external models, and secondly, risks \\narising from the use of these models’ output. In response to the rapid growth of Chat GPT and \\nsimilar tools, we quickly published binding legal guidance that all Beiersdorf employees must follow \\nwhen using these applications. This is designed in particular to avoid errors in the handling of \\ncopyrights and data protection. We have also put our own Beiersdorf GPT environment in place, \\nwhere the models can be trained securely on our own data. The insights from the first large-scale \\napplication cases are being communicated in such a way that they can be applied to other trials. \\nAlongside research and development, we have begun particularly in marketing to intensively \\nexplore the risks and opportunities as part of a task force. This work is looking at both creative \\nopportunities and productivity-boosting aspects of the new technology. We will continue to work on \\nshaping the framework for the safe use of these tools. At the current time, and partly because the \\napplication cases are still limited, we categorize the risk as low and unlikely. \\nFunctional risks and opportunities\\nWe once again had all functional risks and opportunities evaluated by the global functions during the \\nreporting period. Given the strong overlap with the strategic risks and opportunities in some cases, \\nseparate quantification is not useful for the most part. This particularly applies to the topics of \\nreputation, climate change, sustainability, and procurement. For all these topics, however, we take \\nadditional compensatory measures from a purely functional perspective, which in the case of strategic \\nrisks are limited to the main activities. One example is the use of procurement contracts with protective \\nclauses to reduce the volatility affecting important raw materials and packing materials in uncertain \\nmarkets. \\nWe have classed non-conformity in relation to European capital markets law as only a functional \\nrisk, for example, specifically as it concerns the risk of insider trading or non-compliance in terms of \\nrequired adhoc reporting. Here we have been providing regular, target-specific training since many \\nyears. We also ensure continuous internal information sharing on potentially relevant ad hoc facts. An \\nad hoc committee evaluates and documents the information. We assess the risk to be medium and \\npossible.\\nAnother purely functional risk concerns market risk from investments. Potential default risks relating \\nto the investment of the Group’s liquid funds are limited by only making investments with defined \\nreliable counterparties. Counterparty risk is monitored daily based on ratings and the counterparties’ \\nliable capital as well as continuously updated risk indicators. These parameters are used to determine \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n162\\nmaximum amounts for investments with partner banks and securities issuers (counterparty limits), which \\nare compared with the investments actually made throughout the Group. We have invested most of our \\nliquidity in low-risk investments (such as government/corporate bonds and Pfandbriefe). The investment \\nstrategy, which is documented in writing, is regularly agreed with our internal supervisory body and \\nwith the Supervisory Board. Our risk management process includes looking at the conditional value at \\nrisk so that even extreme market situations can be simulated, understood, and factored into investment \\ndecisions. Our financial risk management is characterized by the clear allocation of responsibilities, \\ncentral rules for limiting financial risks as a matter of principle, and the conscious alignment of the \\ninstruments deployed with the requirements of our business activities. Specific, additional information \\non the extent of the currency, interest rate, default, and liquidity risks described above can be found in \\nNote 29 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, “Additional Disclosures on Financial \\nInstruments, Financial Risk Management, and Derivative Financial Instruments.” The higher interest \\nrates make our cautious strategy easier to implement. We therefore categorize this risk as medium but \\nunlikely.\\nLastly, there is a risk from tax and customs audits in a challenging economic environment, particularly in \\nthe context of some important changes in our global transfer pricing model. Here, we see the specific \\nrisk that local affiliates may not be able to provide the relevant documentation, leading to non-\\nacceptance of our transfer pricing and thus higher taxes. We have therefore stepped up our efforts in \\ntax training and our general communication on tax-related topics. At the same time, we are working to \\ndevelop digital applications for more transparency and common global standards, for example in \\nrelation to tax calculation and documentation. We have also increased the support from third-party \\nexperts on certain issues. Overall, we consider the risk to be major and possible.\\nShort-term operational risks and opportunities\\nAlongside the possible long-term impacts of the many geopolitical and economic uncertainties \\nhighlighted in the strategic risks, we also see ramifications of this volatility for operational risks. Price \\nnegotiations with our customers and the reaction of our consumers to changing prices will play an \\nimportant role. Over the past two years, we have gathered valuable experience that we have used in \\nour analytical tools for simulation purposes. With just a few exceptions, the key assumptions on prices \\nand volumes have therefore already been fully incorporated into the basic plan. We regard the risk of \\neffects exceeding this as improbable and low. \\nThe general risk of a pandemic has been included in our functional risks for the last years along with the \\ncorresponding measures. Our short-term assessment changed in the reporting period to the extent that \\nthe end of pandemic restrictions in many countries enabled positive catch-up effects, especially in \\ncategories such as sun protection and lip care. We have generally included these opportunities in the \\nbasic forecast and do not see any further significant effects in the medium term.\\nThe key net operational risks currently remaining arise exclusively from legal and tax proceedings and \\nfrom tax audits, as in the previous period. These risks are prudently quantified by both internal and \\nexternal experts to the extent possible. Assessing the course and outcome of legal disputes is \\nassociated with considerable uncertainty. Based on the information currently available, no material \\ncharges are expected for the Group that would be considered probable.\\nFurther information and details on the extent of the risks described here can be found in Note 30 of the \\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements, “Contingent Liabilities, Other Financial Obligations, and \\nLegal Risks.”\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n163\\nMonitoring of risks and opportunities\\nFormal monitoring of the strategic and functional risks, including corresponding mitigating measures, \\ntakes place once a year at division board and full Executive Board level and subsequently in the Audit \\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board. Along with adherence to our risk policy principles, this naturally \\nfeeds into every business decision taken at the various levels of our company.\\nIn addition to the above monitoring, operational risks and opportunities are continuously monitored as \\npart of the financial planning, forecasting, and reporting process at the local, regional, and central \\nlevels. This ensures that all sales and earnings effects regarded as relatively likely are directly and \\nappropriately incorporated into our financial reporting, taking into account the measures implemented \\nand planned (e.g., recognition of provisions). This is supplemented by a monthly review of key financial \\nfigures for the Group companies, led by the Group Controlling function together with Risk \\nManagement, Internal Audit, and other relevant controlling functions. The review is designed to enable \\npotentially critical developments to be addressed swiftly and precisely with those involved and \\ncorrective action to be initiated where appropriate.\\nThe latest information on risk development is thus also fed into the management and planning systems \\nof the corporate units regularly throughout the year and becomes part of the decision-making and \\ncontrol processes. By directly integrating the risk inventory and planning process, the risk management \\nsystem is continuously developed further, and risk awareness is embedded throughout the company.\\nSummary of the risk situation\\nLooking at the individual risks, we assess the likelihood of occurrence for the material existing risks to \\nhave increased compared with the previous year only in the case of “reputational risks to brands and \\nthe company.” Given that the three new strategic risks were largely covered by the functional risks in the \\nprevious period, there is no change to the risk situation as a whole. In some cases (digital acceleration, \\nshortages of materials and energy), we have reduced our estimate of the potential financial impact \\nshould the existing strategic risks occur. However, we have added new strategic risks at the same time. \\nWe therefore see no overall need for qualitative repositioning specifically for strategic risks.\\nEven considering the updated estimations, there is currently no fundamental change to our assessment \\nof the overall risk situation. As in the previous year, this assessment was substantiated by comparing the \\ncurrent quantitatively and qualitatively aggregated total risk portfolio with the very conservatively \\ncalculated risk-bearing capacity of the Beiersdorf Group. Risk-bearing capacity has slightly increased, \\npartly due to the Group’s further improved liquidity position. This analysis has confirmed Beiersdorf’s \\nview that, at the current time, neither the Beiersdorf Group nor individual segments of the business are \\nexposed to any risks that could endanger their continued existence.\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n164\\nAccounting-related internal control system\\nThe aim of the accounting-related internal control system is to implement appropriate principles, \\nprocedures, and controls to ensure the correctness and reliability of accounting and financial reporting \\nin the financial statements and management report of the Beiersdorf Group and Beiersdorf AG in line \\nwith the legal regulations and relevant accounting standards.\\nThe scope and orientation of the internal control system have been shaped by the Executive Board \\nbased on the Group-specific requirements. The accounting-related internal control system consists of \\nthe following components: control environment, risk assessment process, control activities, information, \\ncommunication, and monitoring.\\nAn analysis was used to identify the items and positions containing the material risks for the financial \\nstatements. The underlying processes were then assigned to these. Preventive, monitoring, and \\ndetective measures designed to ensure security and control in accounting, information processing, and \\nthe operational functions have been defined Group-wide for these processes. Among other things, the \\nmeasures include the separation of functions, manual and IT-based approval processes using the dual \\ncontrol principle, IT checks, access restrictions and authorization concepts for the IT system, and \\nsystems-based processes for handling Group accounting data. These measures are updated regularly.\\nInternal and external shared service centers provide uniform handling of the core accounting processes \\nat Beiersdorf AG and most of its affiliates. In some cases, they achieve this with the help of fully \\nautomated processes. Standardized IT systems are used to support financial reporting for the affiliates \\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements and consolidation. Procedural instructions, \\nstandardized reporting formats, and IT-based reporting and consolidation processes support financial \\nreporting.\\nThe consolidated financial statements are based on accounting directives specified by Beiersdorf AG. \\nThese guidelines are updated on an ongoing basis through continuous analysis of the relevance and \\nimpact of changes in the regulatory environment.\\nThe accounting process and compliance with the control requirements and accounting directives by the \\ncompanies included in the consolidated financial statements are also regularly reviewed and adjusted if \\nnecessary.\\nIt remains the case that even putting in place appropriate, effective systems does not guarantee the \\ncorrect, complete, and timely recording of information in the accounts with absolute certainty. It is \\nimpossible to entirely rule out personal judgments, erroneous controls, criminal acts, or other \\ncircumstances. Should these occur, they could limit the effectiveness and reliability of the internal \\ncontrol system.\\nAdequacy and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management \\nsystems1\\nIn addition to the accounting-related processes, risk early warning and monitoring systems, and related \\ncontrols, all of which are continuously and systematically audited by internal audit, both centrally and \\nlocally, Beiersdorf also has extensive internal rules, regulations, and processes (including \\ninterdepartmental processes) in all areas material to ensuring proper and legally compliant operations \\n(e.g., in R&D, production and logistics, quality management, and marketing and sales, and especially in \\nthe innovation process, which involves practically all corporate functions). The rules and regulations are \\nregularly communicated and updated as appropriate. Compliance with them is monitored and training \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n165\\n1 This section of the Combined Management Report is not subject to audit requirements.\\ncontinuously provided. We have developed data collection and control mechanisms for sustainability \\naspects, too. Internal Audit regularly checks that these are being adhered to. We also implemented an \\nintegrated IT system for Risk Management in 2023, bringing together risks in the areas of finance, \\ncompliance, and sustainability. The Executive Board deals with the monitoring and control of these \\nsystems on an ongoing basis, also in close consultation with Internal Auditing. The Executive Board is \\nregularly advised and monitored by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on issues relating to \\nthe appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and \\nthe internal auditing system. This has not recently resulted in any significant need for adjustment or \\nimprovement with regard to these systems. Beiersdorf therefore has no reason to believe that there are \\ninadequate or ineffective internal control and risk management systems in the relevant business areas \\nor in relation to the relevant topics.\\nIndependent monitoring\\nThe supervisory bodies and the Internal Audit department are integrated into the Beiersdorf Group’s \\ninternal control system with audit activities that are independent of the Group’s operations. Internal \\nAudit systematically evaluates the integrity of financial accounting, the effectiveness of the accounting-\\nrelated internal control system and of the risk and opportunity management system, and compliance. \\nAs a process-independent organizational unit, it uses a risk-based approach to reviewing the business \\nprocesses, the systems and controls that have been put in place, and the financial accounting of \\ntransactions. The audit findings are used for ongoing enhancement of the company’s management and \\nof preventive and detective controls. A standardized monitoring system was introduced in 2022, \\nenabling implementation of the controls to be globally monitored, initially in the order-to-cash and \\npurchase-to-pay core business processes. Use of the system was further refined and expanded in 2023.\\nIn accordance with § 317 (4) HGB and § 91 (2) AktG, the Group auditor also evaluates the effectiveness \\nof the risk early warning and monitoring system. Internal Audit and the Group auditor regularly report \\nthe audit results to the supervisory bodies.\\nThe Audit Committee of Beiersdorf AG monitors, in particular, the accounting process and the \\neffectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and the internal audit system. \\nAlongside standard reports, in-depth analyses on fundamental and/or currently relevant issues are \\nregularly used for information purposes.\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n166', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}')]"

metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Risk Report\\nRisks and opportunities\\nIn the course of its business activities, the Beiersdorf Group is exposed to a multitude of risks and \\nopportunities. These risks and opportunities result, among other things, from its activities that seek to \\ndevelop and make use of opportunities to improve the company’s competitiveness. Risks and \\nopportunities encompass specific events and developments with a certain probability of occurrence \\nthat may have material negative or positive financial and/or non-financial effects on the achievement of \\nthe Beiersdorf Group’s objectives. Beiersdorf uses an integrated risk and opportunity management \\nsystem to identify and evaluate material risks at an early stage and to consistently limit them using \\ncounteractive measures. This system is coordinated at Group headquarters.\\nBeiersdorf Risk Radar\\nSchematic diagram\\nIntegrated risk and opportunity management system\\nThe risk and opportunity management system at Beiersdorf is an integral part of the central and local \\nplanning, management, and control processes in the individual companies, management units, and \\nregions, at Consumer and tesa Business Segment levels, and at Group level. Risk and opportunity \\nmanagement is complemented by the accounting-related internal control systems, the various internal \\nand external monitoring bodies – supported by Internal Audit – and external auditors. Compliance \\nmanagement, which is also relevant in this context, is described extensively in the chapter “Non-\\nfinancial Statement.”\\nRisk and opportunity management is closely aligned with corporate strategy and helps Beiersdorf to \\nidentify its potential and to analyze and make optimal use of this potential while always taking risks into \\naccount. Regularly performing analyses of customers and the competition, for example, enables a swift \\nresponse to dynamic market developments. Specific market opportunities and risks are derived from \\nthe information obtained.\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n156\\nBeiersdorf actively incurs risks only if there is a corresponding opportunity for an appropriate increase \\nin value, and only if they can be managed using established methods and measures within the relevant \\norganization. In cases where the full avoidance of risks is not possible or reasonable, risks are mitigated \\nusing appropriate measures, or are transferred to third parties such as insurance companies.\\nWithin the risk management process, periodic inventories are carried out to identify, evaluate, \\ndocument, and subsequently communicate the material risks in a structured way along with the \\nmeasures to manage these risks. The corresponding principles, reporting and feedback processes, and \\nresponsibilities are laid out in a directive that applies across the Group. This is updated regularly.\\nBeiersdorf Risk Presentation\\nBeiersdorf distinguishes between strategic, functional, and operational risks. Strategic risks encompass \\nfundamental frameworks, developments, and events that could have a substantial impact on the \\nGroup’s business model or its business segments. Functional risks are challenges inherent to the \\nbusiness model. The various specialist functions generally work at the global or regional level to \\ncounter these risks, with sustainable actions relating to the design of operational and organizational \\nstructures as well as with specific individual measures. The opportunities and risks associated with \\nclimate change are also particularly integrated into strategic and functional risk management. \\nOperational risks and opportunities are those that may influence short-term sales and profits of our \\ncorporate affiliates. Appropriate observation periods are assigned to these risk categories.\\nA period of five years generally applies for strategic risks. For functional risks, the period is two years as \\na rule, and for short-term operational risks one year.\\nIn the Group’s internal risk reporting, individual risks are uniformly presented by positioning them on \\nthe Beiersdorf Risk Radar. The various fields of the radar reflect, in summarized form, the relevant areas \\nfor the company both inside and outside the Group that may give rise to risks. The graph on the \\nprevious page (Beiersdorf Risk Radar) shows the structure of the risk radar for strategic risks. By \\ncombining financial, sustainability-related, and legal compliance topics in a single system, the radar has \\nbeen expanded from 8 to 16 topics.\\nFor each category, the risks are also classified based on their probability and the potential financial and \\nnon-financial impact of their occurrence. The likelihood of occurrence and impact of risks are \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n157\\ndetermined on a net basis, assuming that risk-mitigation measures have already been implemented or \\nat least that specific plans for them exist.\\nThe Executive Board and supervisory bodies are regularly updated on the risk situation at Consumer \\nand tesa Business Segment levels and at Group level. Besides this, direct lines of communication ensure \\nthat suddenly occurring material risks are also reported immediately to management.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5302, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

By \\ncombining financial, sustainability-related, and legal compliance topics in a single system, the radar has \\nbeen expanded from 8 to 16 topics.\\nFor each category, the risks are also classified based on their probability and the potential financial and \\nnon-financial impact of their occurrence. The likelihood of occurrence and impact of risks are \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n157\\ndetermined on a net basis, assuming that risk-mitigation measures have already been implemented or \\nat least that specific plans for them exist.\\nThe Executive Board and supervisory bodies are regularly updated on the risk situation at Consumer \\nand tesa Business Segment levels and at Group level. Besides this, direct lines of communication ensure \\nthat suddenly occurring material risks are also reported immediately to management. Continuous \\ninformation sharing with the Corporate Development function additionally encourages the \\nconsideration of risk aspects in the support provided to management. Central risk management is also \\nin constant communication with topic-specific task forces, which are created by the Executive Board as \\nnecessary.\\nThe Corporate Risk Board (CRiB), which was newly established in 2022, continued its work in the \\nreporting year and is a key body advising the Executive Board on risk management matters. The CRiB \\ncontinues to consist of the heads of important, mostly globally responsible corporate departments \\ncomprising multiple areas of responsibility (Marketing, Quality Management, Internal Audit, \\nCommunication, Sustainability, Group Accounting, IT Security, Legal). The task of this body is to collate \\nthe various risks – both those already known and those newly identified by the Corporate Risk Board – \\nusing a broad-based approach and to analyze them in depth and present them in summarized form. By \\nbringing together many different perspectives, it provides Beiersdorf with important collective \\nintelligence, further improving and complementing the existing analysis of material risks.\\nAs in the previous year, in analyzing the material risks and opportunities, the Executive Board and \\nSupervisory Board looked at the comparison of the qualitatively and quantitatively aggregated risk \\nportfolio with the updated financial total risk-bearing capacity. The aim was again to determine whether \\nthere was any need for a change in the overall assessment of the risk situation (see below) on this basis.\\nTo ensure maximum transparency and accountability, Beiersdorf’s financial risk-bearing capacity is \\ncalculated based on average net liquidity. The available free cash flow to be used for the development \\nof net liquidity in the multi-period perspective is adjusted solely for the previously deducted \\ninvestments in securities and effects from past M&A transactions. The calculation of risk-bearing \\ncapacity is therefore based on a very conservative approach, as it deliberately does not take into \\naccount potentially significant short-term increases in our liquidity, which could be used in actual crisis \\nsituations.\\nThese increases could include, for example, new and/or increased credit lines, the release of hidden \\nreserves, the sale of fixed assets, individual business units, or own shares from our portfolio, the \\ntemporary suspension of dividend payments, or the reduction of planned investments in the market or \\nin maintaining/expanding our fixed assets. Lastly, for net liquidity and cash flow, we have used only the \\naverage for the last five years, rather than the higher recent figures for 2023.\\nAs a result of comparing the risk situation with risk-bearing capacity, it can be concluded that, over the \\nrelevant observation period of the next two years, the current risk portfolio, revalued during the \\nreporting year, would still not give rise to a financial situation even remotely endangering the Beiersdorf \\nGroup’s continued existence, even given the full and simultaneous occurrence of all the individual risks. \\nDescription of the material risks and opportunities\\nStrategic risks and opportunities\\nAll strategic risks that already existed in 2022 or newly emerged in the 2023 reporting year were again \\nsubjected to a comprehensive review. Where necessary, we adjusted the precise definitions of these \\nrisks and our assessment of their probability and/or impact. This analysis showed no material year-on-\\nyear change in the overall risk situation. Increased risk in some areas, such as climate-related effects \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n158\\nalong the entire value chain, were offset by lower risks in others, for example in relation to the energy \\nsupply situation. In addition, in line with our cautious approach, we have currently completely removed \\nopportunities beyond our medium-term planning from the quantitative net calculation of the risk \\nportfolio. This approach was also taken in the previous year.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=4275, end_char_idx=9456, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

opportunities\\nStrategic risks and opportunities\\nAll strategic risks that already existed in 2022 or newly emerged in the 2023 reporting year were again \\nsubjected to a comprehensive review. Where necessary, we adjusted the precise definitions of these \\nrisks and our assessment of their probability and/or impact. This analysis showed no material year-on-\\nyear change in the overall risk situation. Increased risk in some areas, such as climate-related effects \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n158\\nalong the entire value chain, were offset by lower risks in others, for example in relation to the energy \\nsupply situation. In addition, in line with our cautious approach, we have currently completely removed \\nopportunities beyond our medium-term planning from the quantitative net calculation of the risk \\nportfolio. This approach was also taken in the previous year. We have also removed some risk aspects, \\nthat, we regard as part of the day-to-day challenges we continuously face as part of our business model, \\nfrom the definition of strategic risks, since these are generally already captured by our financial \\nplanning. These include, for example, recurring disputes with retailers over pricing, diverse attacks on \\nour brands and products by competitors, and, in particular, the defense of our trademarks and product \\nclaims.\\n1. Reputational risks to brands and the company\\nMaintaining and increasing the value of our major consumer brands with their broad appeal remains \\nof decisive importance to Beiersdorf’s business development. The trust of our customers and, in \\nparticular, of the consumers of our products, is essential to this and cannot be taken for granted. We \\nhave designed our risk management system to fully justify this trust and to provide enduring, \\nsuccessful protection to the value of our brands. We continuously review our internal processes in all \\nareas of the company in order that we can respond appropriately, correctly, and effectively to any \\nevents that could harm or threaten our reputation. Combined with the activities described below in \\nrelation to the quality of our products and overall market image, we expect this to help prevent any \\npotential reputational problems from escalating into critical issues. This applies equally to our \\nbrands and to our company as a whole. Our extensive operational and communication measures in \\nrelation to sustainability, diversity, and other aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) also \\nhelp to limit the risks. In the short term, however, we see a slight increase in net risk as a result of the \\nnew Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, LkSG), despite \\nall the measures already implemented. We categorize the risks to the reputation of our brands and \\nour company as medium and possible overall.\\n2. Critical ingredients\\nFor a clearer distinction and risk assessment, we have presented the risk arising from the use of \\ncritical ingredients separately from general procurement risks in this report. Our research and \\ndevelopment department, with its broad expertise and geographical coverage, ensures that we \\nalways comply with all local legal requirements. It is supported in this by a specialized regulatory \\naffairs function. We are also in permanent dialogue with the relevant authorities so that we can react \\nin good time when changes to product formulation requirements begin to emerge. As a member of \\nthe relevant associations, particularly at the European level, we as a company receive early notice of \\nemerging changes. This also includes our regular dialogue with the key suppliers. In the reporting \\nyear, we made further improvements to our internal process for dealing with critical ingredients. \\nHowever, we note that challenges are growing with the further spread of digital applications and \\nchannels critical of the ingredients used in the cosmetics industry. We continue to categorize the risk \\nas medium and possible. \\n3. Accelerating digitalization\\nThe penetration of digital technology in consumer interaction all along the marketing and sales \\nprocess is still constantly increasing. Beiersdorf therefore continues to work hard at planning and \\nimplementing these interactions in a way that makes them as specific to the target group as \\npossible. We made considerable efforts in precision marketing in 2023, enabling us to invest \\nsignificantly more effectively. At the same time, we put in place organizational measures for even \\nmore integrated working, across all brands, between the functions and IT in close collaboration with \\nthe business. Specifically in e-commerce, we further increased our resourcing to reflect the growing \\nimportance of this channel. Recruiting and retaining suitable talent remains a big challenge.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=8459, end_char_idx=13377, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Accelerating digitalization\\nThe penetration of digital technology in consumer interaction all along the marketing and sales \\nprocess is still constantly increasing. Beiersdorf therefore continues to work hard at planning and \\nimplementing these interactions in a way that makes them as specific to the target group as \\npossible. We made considerable efforts in precision marketing in 2023, enabling us to invest \\nsignificantly more effectively. At the same time, we put in place organizational measures for even \\nmore integrated working, across all brands, between the functions and IT in close collaboration with \\nthe business. Specifically in e-commerce, we further increased our resourcing to reflect the growing \\nimportance of this channel. Recruiting and retaining suitable talent remains a big challenge. This is \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n159\\nparticularly the case in the field of data analysis, which is crucially important for generating fast and \\naccurate information to guide our actions, including in close dialogue with our customers. Another \\naspect is ensuring the full protection of private data. Our data protection management system, \\nglobally steered and locally implemented, helps us ensure that sensitive data of our company, \\nbusiness partners, and consumers is handled securely at all times. This includes, for example, the \\ndevelopment and use of our social media presence and the development of new software solutions. \\nThese efforts are complemented by clear internal rules of conduct, transparent management \\nstructures, extensive training and monitoring activities, and, in the case of data protection, further \\nwork on global roll-out. In this reporting period, as a result of our various measures, we regard the \\nrisk as medium and possible. \\n4. Growing political and economic uncertainty\\nThe global political situation remained very fraught in the reporting period. Alongside the war in \\nUkraine, the new military conflict in the Middle East is causing uncertainty, as it is unclear whether it \\nwill spread to the wider region. Any such spread could then also have somewhat larger direct \\nimpacts on our business in this region. While the US-China relationship has not deteriorated further \\nin recent months, it continues to represent significant uncertainty. \\nThe outlook for the world economy is difficult to assess overall, since the effects of the very sharp \\ninterest rate hikes of the last 18 months may take some time to be fully reflected in the economic \\nfigures. Highly indebted countries in particular are at high risk if materially higher borrowing costs \\nweigh on current budgets. The same applies to highly indebted individual companies with which \\nBeiersdorf has a direct or indirect business relationship. The real estate crisis in China is potentially a \\nnot-to-be-underestimated factor in this regard. At the same time, Beiersdorf remains geographically \\nrelatively well balanced across all its divisions, without extreme dependency on a particular market. \\nPotential market entries in new countries are comprehensively evaluated in their economic and \\npolitical context. In the case of Russia, care is taken to strictly comply with all sanctions. Nevertheless, \\nwe categorize the risk from the impact of an escalating military conflict or economic crisis in a market \\nrelevant to Beiersdorf as major and possible overall.\\n5. Shortage of raw materials, natural resources, and energy\\nThe general procurement situation has improved in recent months with the easing of COVID-19-\\nrelated restrictions in the global supply chain. This is also evident in falling prices for some important \\nraw materials and packaging materials, even though many categories have not reached the price \\nlevel seen before the pandemic. The same applies to the energy supply, which is regarded as \\nlargely secure at the current time. To allow us to respond swiftly and appropriately to potential \\nfuture supply crises, we are continuously monitoring our markets and suppliers and use appropriate \\ncontract management. Procurement also carefully manages the scope, timing, and frequency of our \\nindividual purchases. Strategic partnerships remain an important element of actively managing our \\nsupplier portfolio, as do internal programs designed to ensure the agility of the supply chain as a \\nwhole and its resilience to disruption. In addition, we are intensively seeking potential cost \\nreductions throughout the value chain as part of the continuation of our broad-based value \\nengineering project. While we see overall positive trends, this area remains one of significant \\nuncertainty. Therefore, we regard the strategic and functional risks in relation to availability and \\nprice trends on the procurement side as medium and possible given the volatile environment.\\n6. Cybersecurity\\nAs part of the review of our strategic risks, we have now returned to reporting the risk from threats to \\nour IT system and the IT systems of our direct business partners as a specific individual risk.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=12503, end_char_idx=17678, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Procurement also carefully manages the scope, timing, and frequency of our \\nindividual purchases. Strategic partnerships remain an important element of actively managing our \\nsupplier portfolio, as do internal programs designed to ensure the agility of the supply chain as a \\nwhole and its resilience to disruption. In addition, we are intensively seeking potential cost \\nreductions throughout the value chain as part of the continuation of our broad-based value \\nengineering project. While we see overall positive trends, this area remains one of significant \\nuncertainty. Therefore, we regard the strategic and functional risks in relation to availability and \\nprice trends on the procurement side as medium and possible given the volatile environment.\\n6. Cybersecurity\\nAs part of the review of our strategic risks, we have now returned to reporting the risk from threats to \\nour IT system and the IT systems of our direct business partners as a specific individual risk. This \\nreflects the special and further increasing significance of this risk. This year, the risk of physical \\nunavailability of critical infrastructure excluding IT (chiefly production and storage centers, including \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n160\\ntransport) has been allocated to risks from climate change. With regard to cybersecurity, we \\nsuccessfully defended ourselves again in 2023 against direct and indirect attacks on our own IT \\nsystems. We achieved further improvements in IT infrastructure, particularly in cloud services. We \\nused technical and training-based measures to reduce the particular risk arising from increased \\nworking from home. We also repeated our ISO 27001 certification as an important independent \\nconfirmation of our efforts. In addition, we began to even better protect our operational systems \\nalong the value chain. In light of the growing overall number of threats, we categorize the risk as \\nmedium and possible, despite all the progress achieved.\\n7. Growing ESG requirements\\nRegulatory requirements in this area are constantly increasing. This is due particularly to the \\nEuropean Green Deal, which is implemented through national law, and to the \\nLieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, LkSG). Irrespective of \\nlegal requirements, Beiersdorf has been setting very high goals. This is evident from our own \\nspecific sustainability targets in relation to packaging reduction and avoidance, as well as climate \\nprotection. We are continuing to follow through on implementing our new plastics cycle strategy, \\nfirst announced in 2021, along with our efforts to develop and use sustainable packaging and \\napplications. We have continuously increased our ability to transparently measure progress against \\ninterim targets. In 2023, we again held various events in different formats that were designed to help \\nimprove the awareness and understanding of our employees and managers around the topics of \\nthe environment and sustainability. We also organized a global diversity and inclusion week in 2023 \\nto share our progress and announce ambitious new targets, for example in relation to people with \\ndisabilities. To meet the requirements of the new LkSG, we held training programs primarily on \\naspects related to human rights, both internally and for our suppliers. At the same time, we began \\nassessing and auditing suppliers in relation to this legislation. Given their large number, it will take \\nan extended period of time for this process to cover all our business partners. We anticipate that \\nexpectations on the part of the public, NGOs, and our customers will continue to grow in relation to \\nboth our environmental protection efforts and our actions as a responsible corporate citizen. We \\ntherefore still categorize this risk as major and possible. \\n8. Climate change-related effects along the value chain\\nIn this new risk category, we include all the possible impacts of climate change on our entire value \\nchain – from procuring crucial raw materials and packaging to transporting products to end \\ncustomers. In 2023, we arranged for an extensive external study on risk trends at our own locations \\nbetween now and 2040. The resulting insights are now being translated into appropriate packages \\nof measures. We have also begun to set up continuous monitoring of these risks, including for \\ncritical ingredients. Particular attention is being paid to the water supply at our production sites. We \\nare also constantly updating our emergency plans for critical infrastructure and supplies so that we \\ncan swiftly and fully respond to such situations. At the current time, we categorize this risk as \\nmedium and possible.\\n9. Shortage of talent and skills\\nAnother risk, which we are now upgrading from a functional risk to a strategic risk, relates to the \\ngrowing challenge of recruiting and retaining suitable talent and providing all of our individuals with \\nappropriately swift and comprehensive training on new technologies.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=16705, end_char_idx=21786, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='In 2023, we arranged for an extensive external study on risk trends at our own locations \\nbetween now and 2040. The resulting insights are now being translated into appropriate packages \\nof measures. We have also begun to set up continuous monitoring of these risks, including for \\ncritical ingredients. Particular attention is being paid to the water supply at our production sites. We \\nare also constantly updating our emergency plans for critical infrastructure and supplies so that we \\ncan swiftly and fully respond to such situations. At the current time, we categorize this risk as \\nmedium and possible.\\n9. Shortage of talent and skills\\nAnother risk, which we are now upgrading from a functional risk to a strategic risk, relates to the \\ngrowing challenge of recruiting and retaining suitable talent and providing all of our individuals with \\nappropriately swift and comprehensive training on new technologies. This risk affects both our \\nGerman locations and our national companies, particularly in relation to all activities with a strong \\ndigital component. Beiersdorf is competing here not only with other players in our industry but also \\nespecially also with technology firms both large and small. As our most important measure, we \\ntherefore worked urgently in the reporting year on a new employer branding program, which we \\nwill shortly roll out worldwide. We have also stepped up our presence on social media, including by \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n161\\ninvolving all senior managers in our external communications, so as to raise Beiersdorf’s profile and \\nincrease awareness of us as an attractive employer. Partnerships and contacts with universities also \\nserve to build links with qualified potential new employees so that we can prepare them for a career \\nat Beiersdorf through special trainee programs. As in previous years, we reviewed our employees’ \\nsatisfaction using an external, standardized, and anonymous survey, comparing the results both to \\nour own track record and the wider market. The results showed a further slight improvement on the \\nprevious year’s very high satisfaction level. The even greater focus internally on regular, high-quality \\npersonal development meetings and measures should have contributed to this. We have launched \\ntraining programs to tailor employees’ skills to the constantly growing requirements, particularly in \\nrelation to digital technology. These cover general and function-specific skills for which our various \\nacademies are responsible. Given our current competitive strength, we currently assess this risk to \\nbe low and possible.\\n10. Generative artificial intelligence\\nWe have listed this risk, which also represents an incredible opportunity, separately from the risk of \\ngeneral digital acceleration in order to reflect the very rapid pace of developments in this area. As a \\nbrand owner, Beiersdorf is also exposed to particular challenges here. We distinguish between two \\ntypes of risks: firstly, risks arising from the feeding of data to external models, and secondly, risks \\narising from the use of these models’ output. In response to the rapid growth of Chat GPT and \\nsimilar tools, we quickly published binding legal guidance that all Beiersdorf employees must follow \\nwhen using these applications. This is designed in particular to avoid errors in the handling of \\ncopyrights and data protection. We have also put our own Beiersdorf GPT environment in place, \\nwhere the models can be trained securely on our own data. The insights from the first large-scale \\napplication cases are being communicated in such a way that they can be applied to other trials. \\nAlongside research and development, we have begun particularly in marketing to intensively \\nexplore the risks and opportunities as part of a task force. This work is looking at both creative \\nopportunities and productivity-boosting aspects of the new technology. We will continue to work on \\nshaping the framework for the safe use of these tools. At the current time, and partly because the \\napplication cases are still limited, we categorize the risk as low and unlikely. \\nFunctional risks and opportunities\\nWe once again had all functional risks and opportunities evaluated by the global functions during the \\nreporting period. Given the strong overlap with the strategic risks and opportunities in some cases, \\nseparate quantification is not useful for the most part. This particularly applies to the topics of \\nreputation, climate change, sustainability, and procurement. For all these topics, however, we take \\nadditional compensatory measures from a purely functional perspective, which in the case of strategic \\nrisks are limited to the main activities. One example is the use of procurement contracts with protective \\nclauses to reduce the volatility affecting important raw materials and packing materials in uncertain \\nmarkets.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=20870, end_char_idx=25845, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

At the current time, and partly because the \\napplication cases are still limited, we categorize the risk as low and unlikely. \\nFunctional risks and opportunities\\nWe once again had all functional risks and opportunities evaluated by the global functions during the \\nreporting period. Given the strong overlap with the strategic risks and opportunities in some cases, \\nseparate quantification is not useful for the most part. This particularly applies to the topics of \\nreputation, climate change, sustainability, and procurement. For all these topics, however, we take \\nadditional compensatory measures from a purely functional perspective, which in the case of strategic \\nrisks are limited to the main activities. One example is the use of procurement contracts with protective \\nclauses to reduce the volatility affecting important raw materials and packing materials in uncertain \\nmarkets. \\nWe have classed non-conformity in relation to European capital markets law as only a functional \\nrisk, for example, specifically as it concerns the risk of insider trading or non-compliance in terms of \\nrequired adhoc reporting. Here we have been providing regular, target-specific training since many \\nyears. We also ensure continuous internal information sharing on potentially relevant ad hoc facts. An \\nad hoc committee evaluates and documents the information. We assess the risk to be medium and \\npossible.\\nAnother purely functional risk concerns market risk from investments. Potential default risks relating \\nto the investment of the Group’s liquid funds are limited by only making investments with defined \\nreliable counterparties. Counterparty risk is monitored daily based on ratings and the counterparties’ \\nliable capital as well as continuously updated risk indicators. These parameters are used to determine \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n162\\nmaximum amounts for investments with partner banks and securities issuers (counterparty limits), which \\nare compared with the investments actually made throughout the Group. We have invested most of our \\nliquidity in low-risk investments (such as government/corporate bonds and Pfandbriefe). The investment \\nstrategy, which is documented in writing, is regularly agreed with our internal supervisory body and \\nwith the Supervisory Board. Our risk management process includes looking at the conditional value at \\nrisk so that even extreme market situations can be simulated, understood, and factored into investment \\ndecisions. Our financial risk management is characterized by the clear allocation of responsibilities, \\ncentral rules for limiting financial risks as a matter of principle, and the conscious alignment of the \\ninstruments deployed with the requirements of our business activities. Specific, additional information \\non the extent of the currency, interest rate, default, and liquidity risks described above can be found in \\nNote 29 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, “Additional Disclosures on Financial \\nInstruments, Financial Risk Management, and Derivative Financial Instruments.” The higher interest \\nrates make our cautious strategy easier to implement. We therefore categorize this risk as medium but \\nunlikely.\\nLastly, there is a risk from tax and customs audits in a challenging economic environment, particularly in \\nthe context of some important changes in our global transfer pricing model. Here, we see the specific \\nrisk that local affiliates may not be able to provide the relevant documentation, leading to non-\\nacceptance of our transfer pricing and thus higher taxes. We have therefore stepped up our efforts in \\ntax training and our general communication on tax-related topics. At the same time, we are working to \\ndevelop digital applications for more transparency and common global standards, for example in \\nrelation to tax calculation and documentation. We have also increased the support from third-party \\nexperts on certain issues. Overall, we consider the risk to be major and possible.\\nShort-term operational risks and opportunities\\nAlongside the possible long-term impacts of the many geopolitical and economic uncertainties \\nhighlighted in the strategic risks, we also see ramifications of this volatility for operational risks. Price \\nnegotiations with our customers and the reaction of our consumers to changing prices will play an \\nimportant role. Over the past two years, we have gathered valuable experience that we have used in \\nour analytical tools for simulation purposes. With just a few exceptions, the key assumptions on prices \\nand volumes have therefore already been fully incorporated into the basic plan. We regard the risk of \\neffects exceeding this as improbable and low. \\nThe general risk of a pandemic has been included in our functional risks for the last years along with the \\ncorresponding measures. Our short-term assessment changed in the reporting period to the extent that \\nthe end of pandemic restrictions in many countries enabled positive catch-up effects, especially in \\ncategories such as sun protection and lip care.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=24871, end_char_idx=30107, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

opportunities\\nAlongside the possible long-term impacts of the many geopolitical and economic uncertainties \\nhighlighted in the strategic risks, we also see ramifications of this volatility for operational risks. Price \\nnegotiations with our customers and the reaction of our consumers to changing prices will play an \\nimportant role. Over the past two years, we have gathered valuable experience that we have used in \\nour analytical tools for simulation purposes. With just a few exceptions, the key assumptions on prices \\nand volumes have therefore already been fully incorporated into the basic plan. We regard the risk of \\neffects exceeding this as improbable and low. \\nThe general risk of a pandemic has been included in our functional risks for the last years along with the \\ncorresponding measures. Our short-term assessment changed in the reporting period to the extent that \\nthe end of pandemic restrictions in many countries enabled positive catch-up effects, especially in \\ncategories such as sun protection and lip care. We have generally included these opportunities in the \\nbasic forecast and do not see any further significant effects in the medium term.\\nThe key net operational risks currently remaining arise exclusively from legal and tax proceedings and \\nfrom tax audits, as in the previous period. These risks are prudently quantified by both internal and \\nexternal experts to the extent possible. Assessing the course and outcome of legal disputes is \\nassociated with considerable uncertainty. Based on the information currently available, no material \\ncharges are expected for the Group that would be considered probable.\\nFurther information and details on the extent of the risks described here can be found in Note 30 of the \\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements, “Contingent Liabilities, Other Financial Obligations, and \\nLegal Risks.”\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n163\\nMonitoring of risks and opportunities\\nFormal monitoring of the strategic and functional risks, including corresponding mitigating measures, \\ntakes place once a year at division board and full Executive Board level and subsequently in the Audit \\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board. Along with adherence to our risk policy principles, this naturally \\nfeeds into every business decision taken at the various levels of our company.\\nIn addition to the above monitoring, operational risks and opportunities are continuously monitored as \\npart of the financial planning, forecasting, and reporting process at the local, regional, and central \\nlevels. This ensures that all sales and earnings effects regarded as relatively likely are directly and \\nappropriately incorporated into our financial reporting, taking into account the measures implemented \\nand planned (e.g., recognition of provisions). This is supplemented by a monthly review of key financial \\nfigures for the Group companies, led by the Group Controlling function together with Risk \\nManagement, Internal Audit, and other relevant controlling functions. The review is designed to enable \\npotentially critical developments to be addressed swiftly and precisely with those involved and \\ncorrective action to be initiated where appropriate.\\nThe latest information on risk development is thus also fed into the management and planning systems \\nof the corporate units regularly throughout the year and becomes part of the decision-making and \\ncontrol processes. By directly integrating the risk inventory and planning process, the risk management \\nsystem is continuously developed further, and risk awareness is embedded throughout the company.\\nSummary of the risk situation\\nLooking at the individual risks, we assess the likelihood of occurrence for the material existing risks to \\nhave increased compared with the previous year only in the case of “reputational risks to brands and \\nthe company.” Given that the three new strategic risks were largely covered by the functional risks in the \\nprevious period, there is no change to the risk situation as a whole. In some cases (digital acceleration, \\nshortages of materials and energy), we have reduced our estimate of the potential financial impact \\nshould the existing strategic risks occur. However, we have added new strategic risks at the same time. \\nWe therefore see no overall need for qualitative repositioning specifically for strategic risks.\\nEven considering the updated estimations, there is currently no fundamental change to our assessment \\nof the overall risk situation. As in the previous year, this assessment was substantiated by comparing the \\ncurrent quantitatively and qualitatively aggregated total risk portfolio with the very conservatively \\ncalculated risk-bearing capacity of the Beiersdorf Group. Risk-bearing capacity has slightly increased, \\npartly due to the Group’s further improved liquidity position. This analysis has confirmed Beiersdorf’s \\nview that, at the current time, neither the Beiersdorf Group nor individual segments of the business are \\nexposed to any risks that could endanger their continued existence.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=29043, end_char_idx=34224, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

impact \\nshould the existing strategic risks occur. However, we have added new strategic risks at the same time. \\nWe therefore see no overall need for qualitative repositioning specifically for strategic risks.\\nEven considering the updated estimations, there is currently no fundamental change to our assessment \\nof the overall risk situation. As in the previous year, this assessment was substantiated by comparing the \\ncurrent quantitatively and qualitatively aggregated total risk portfolio with the very conservatively \\ncalculated risk-bearing capacity of the Beiersdorf Group. Risk-bearing capacity has slightly increased, \\npartly due to the Group’s further improved liquidity position. This analysis has confirmed Beiersdorf’s \\nview that, at the current time, neither the Beiersdorf Group nor individual segments of the business are \\nexposed to any risks that could endanger their continued existence.\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n164\\nAccounting-related internal control system\\nThe aim of the accounting-related internal control system is to implement appropriate principles, \\nprocedures, and controls to ensure the correctness and reliability of accounting and financial reporting \\nin the financial statements and management report of the Beiersdorf Group and Beiersdorf AG in line \\nwith the legal regulations and relevant accounting standards.\\nThe scope and orientation of the internal control system have been shaped by the Executive Board \\nbased on the Group-specific requirements. The accounting-related internal control system consists of \\nthe following components: control environment, risk assessment process, control activities, information, \\ncommunication, and monitoring.\\nAn analysis was used to identify the items and positions containing the material risks for the financial \\nstatements. The underlying processes were then assigned to these. Preventive, monitoring, and \\ndetective measures designed to ensure security and control in accounting, information processing, and \\nthe operational functions have been defined Group-wide for these processes. Among other things, the \\nmeasures include the separation of functions, manual and IT-based approval processes using the dual \\ncontrol principle, IT checks, access restrictions and authorization concepts for the IT system, and \\nsystems-based processes for handling Group accounting data. These measures are updated regularly.\\nInternal and external shared service centers provide uniform handling of the core accounting processes \\nat Beiersdorf AG and most of its affiliates. In some cases, they achieve this with the help of fully \\nautomated processes. Standardized IT systems are used to support financial reporting for the affiliates \\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements and consolidation. Procedural instructions, \\nstandardized reporting formats, and IT-based reporting and consolidation processes support financial \\nreporting.\\nThe consolidated financial statements are based on accounting directives specified by Beiersdorf AG. \\nThese guidelines are updated on an ongoing basis through continuous analysis of the relevance and \\nimpact of changes in the regulatory environment.\\nThe accounting process and compliance with the control requirements and accounting directives by the \\ncompanies included in the consolidated financial statements are also regularly reviewed and adjusted if \\nnecessary.\\nIt remains the case that even putting in place appropriate, effective systems does not guarantee the \\ncorrect, complete, and timely recording of information in the accounts with absolute certainty. It is \\nimpossible to entirely rule out personal judgments, erroneous controls, criminal acts, or other \\ncircumstances. Should these occur, they could limit the effectiveness and reliability of the internal \\ncontrol system.\\nAdequacy and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management \\nsystems1\\nIn addition to the accounting-related processes, risk early warning and monitoring systems, and related \\ncontrols, all of which are continuously and systematically audited by internal audit, both centrally and \\nlocally, Beiersdorf also has extensive internal rules, regulations, and processes (including \\ninterdepartmental processes) in all areas material to ensuring proper and legally compliant operations \\n(e.g., in R&D, production and logistics, quality management, and marketing and sales, and especially in \\nthe innovation process, which involves practically all corporate functions). The rules and regulations are \\nregularly communicated and updated as appropriate. Compliance with them is monitored and training \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n165\\n1 This section of the Combined Management Report is not subject to audit requirements.\\ncontinuously provided. We have developed data collection and control mechanisms for sustainability \\naspects, too. Internal Audit regularly checks that these are being adhered to. We also implemented an \\nintegrated IT system for Risk Management in 2023, bringing together risks in the areas of finance, \\ncompliance, and sustainability. The Executive Board deals with the monitoring and control of these \\nsystems on an ongoing basis, also in close consultation with Internal Auditing.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=33188, end_char_idx=38711, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

We have developed data collection and control mechanisms for sustainability \\naspects, too. Internal Audit regularly checks that these are being adhered to. We also implemented an \\nintegrated IT system for Risk Management in 2023, bringing together risks in the areas of finance, \\ncompliance, and sustainability. The Executive Board deals with the monitoring and control of these \\nsystems on an ongoing basis, also in close consultation with Internal Auditing. The Executive Board is \\nregularly advised and monitored by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on issues relating to \\nthe appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and \\nthe internal auditing system. This has not recently resulted in any significant need for adjustment or \\nimprovement with regard to these systems. Beiersdorf therefore has no reason to believe that there are \\ninadequate or ineffective internal control and risk management systems in the relevant business areas \\nor in relation to the relevant topics.\\nIndependent monitoring\\nThe supervisory bodies and the Internal Audit department are integrated into the Beiersdorf Group’s \\ninternal control system with audit activities that are independent of the Group’s operations. Internal \\nAudit systematically evaluates the integrity of financial accounting, the effectiveness of the accounting-\\nrelated internal control system and of the risk and opportunity management system, and compliance. \\nAs a process-independent organizational unit, it uses a risk-based approach to reviewing the business \\nprocesses, the systems and controls that have been put in place, and the financial accounting of \\ntransactions. The audit findings are used for ongoing enhancement of the company’s management and \\nof preventive and detective controls. A standardized monitoring system was introduced in 2022, \\nenabling implementation of the controls to be globally monitored, initially in the order-to-cash and \\npurchase-to-pay core business processes. Use of the system was further refined and expanded in 2023.\\nIn accordance with § 317 (4) HGB and § 91 (2) AktG, the Group auditor also evaluates the effectiveness \\nof the risk early warning and monitoring system. Internal Audit and the Group auditor regularly report \\nthe audit results to the supervisory bodies.\\nThe Audit Committee of Beiersdorf AG monitors, in particular, the accounting process and the \\neffectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and the internal audit system. \\nAlongside standard reports, in-depth analyses on fundamental and/or currently relevant issues are \\nregularly used for information purposes.\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n166', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=37885, end_char_idx=41045, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}')]"

      "\n",
      "Residual value risk is the potential financial risk associated with the future value of an asset at the end of its lease or useful life. This risk is relevant for companies that deal with assets that depreciate over time, such as vehicles or equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "For BMW, which is an automotive manufacturer, residual value risk is a significant concern. The residual value of their vehicles can impact the company's financial performance and profitability. BMW may face residual value risk due to factors such as changing consumer preferences, advancements in technology, or economic conditions that could affect the future value of their cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate residual value risk, automotive companies like BMW typically employ various strategies, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Leasing and Finance Programs: Offering leasing and financing options to customers can help manage residual value risk. By retaining ownership of the vehicle during the lease term, BMW can control the residual value and generate revenue through monthly lease payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Product Planning and Design: BMW may focus on designing vehicles with features and technologies that are likely to remain popular and desirable in the future, potentially increasing their residual values.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Brand Reputation and Customer Loyalty: Building a strong brand image and fostering customer loyalty can positively influence residual values. BMW's reputation for quality and performance may encourage customers to choose their vehicles, even as they age.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Certified Pre-Owned Programs: BMW has a certified pre-owned program that inspects and refurbishes used vehicles to meet certain standards. This program can help maintain the residual value of their cars by providing customers with a more reliable option when purchasing a used BMW.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, I don't have specific information about AstraZeneca's residual value risk exposure or their risk mitigation strategies in this regard. It's important to note that residual value risk may not be as significant for companies in the pharmaceutical industry, like AstraZeneca, compared to industries with tangible depreciable assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you would like more detailed information about BMW's risk mitigation strategies, it would be best to refer to their annual reports, investor relations materials, or contact the company directly.\n"

These risks and opportunities result, among other things, from its activities that seek to \\ndevelop and make use of opportunities to improve the company’s competitiveness. Risks and \\nopportunities encompass specific events and developments with a certain probability of occurrence \\nthat may have material negative or positive financial and/or non-financial effects on the achievement of \\nthe Beiersdorf Group’s objectives. Beiersdorf uses an integrated risk and opportunity management \\nsystem to identify and evaluate material risks at an early stage and to consistently limit them using \\ncounteractive measures. This system is coordinated at Group headquarters.\\nBeiersdorf Risk Radar\\nSchematic diagram\\nIntegrated risk and opportunity management system\\nThe risk and opportunity management system at Beiersdorf is an integral part of the central and local \\nplanning, management, and control processes in the individual companies, management units, and \\nregions, at Consumer and tesa Business Segment levels, and at Group level. Risk and opportunity \\nmanagement is complemented by the accounting-related internal control systems, the various internal \\nand external monitoring bodies – supported by Internal Audit – and external auditors. Compliance \\nmanagement, which is also relevant in this context, is described extensively in the chapter “Non-\\nfinancial Statement.”\\nRisk and opportunity management is closely aligned with corporate strategy and helps Beiersdorf to \\nidentify its potential and to analyze and make optimal use of this potential while always taking risks into \\naccount. Regularly performing analyses of customers and the competition, for example, enables a swift \\nresponse to dynamic market developments. Specific market opportunities and risks are derived from \\nthe information obtained.\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n156\\nBeiersdorf actively incurs risks only if there is a corresponding opportunity for an appropriate increase \\nin value, and only if they can be managed using established methods and measures within the relevant \\norganization. In cases where the full avoidance of risks is not possible or reasonable, risks are mitigated \\nusing appropriate measures, or are transferred to third parties such as insurance companies.\\nWithin the risk management process, periodic inventories are carried out to identify, evaluate, \\ndocument, and subsequently communicate the material risks in a structured way along with the \\nmeasures to manage these risks. The corresponding principles, reporting and feedback processes, and \\nresponsibilities are laid out in a directive that applies across the Group. This is updated regularly.\\nBeiersdorf Risk Presentation\\nBeiersdorf distinguishes between strategic, functional, and operational risks. Strategic risks encompass \\nfundamental frameworks, developments, and events that could have a substantial impact on the \\nGroup’s business model or its business segments. Functional risks are challenges inherent to the \\nbusiness model. The various specialist functions generally work at the global or regional level to \\ncounter these risks, with sustainable actions relating to the design of operational and organizational \\nstructures as well as with specific individual measures. The opportunities and risks associated with \\nclimate change are also particularly integrated into strategic and functional risk management. \\nOperational risks and opportunities are those that may influence short-term sales and profits of our \\ncorporate affiliates. Appropriate observation periods are assigned to these risk categories.\\nA period of five years generally applies for strategic risks. For functional risks, the period is two years as \\na rule, and for short-term operational risks one year.\\nIn the Group’s internal risk reporting, individual risks are uniformly presented by positioning them on \\nthe Beiersdorf Risk Radar. The various fields of the radar reflect, in summarized form, the relevant areas \\nfor the company both inside and outside the Group that may give rise to risks. The graph on the \\nprevious page (Beiersdorf Risk Radar) shows the structure of the risk radar for strategic risks. By \\ncombining financial, sustainability-related, and legal compliance topics in a single system, the radar has \\nbeen expanded from 8 to 16 topics.\\nFor each category, the risks are also classified based on their probability and the potential financial and \\nnon-financial impact of their occurrence. The likelihood of occurrence and impact of risks are \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n157\\ndetermined on a net basis, assuming that risk-mitigation measures have already been implemented or \\nat least that specific plans for them exist.\\nThe Executive Board and supervisory bodies are regularly updated on the risk situation at Consumer \\nand tesa Business Segment levels and at Group level. Besides this, direct lines of communication ensure \\nthat suddenly occurring material risks are also reported immediately to management. Continuous \\ninformation sharing with the Corporate Development function additionally encourages the \\nconsideration of risk aspects in the support provided to management. Central risk management is also \\nin constant communication with topic-specific task forces, which are created by the Executive Board as \\nnecessary.\\nThe Corporate Risk Board (CRiB), which was newly established in 2022, continued its work in the \\nreporting year and is a key body advising the Executive Board on risk management matters. The CRiB \\ncontinues to consist of the heads of important, mostly globally responsible corporate departments \\ncomprising multiple areas of responsibility (Marketing, Quality Management, Internal Audit, \\nCommunication, Sustainability, Group Accounting, IT Security, Legal). The task of this body is to collate \\nthe various risks – both those already known and those newly identified by the Corporate Risk Board – \\nusing a broad-based approach and to analyze them in depth and present them in summarized form. By \\nbringing together many different perspectives, it provides Beiersdorf with important collective \\nintelligence, further improving and complementing the existing analysis of material risks.\\nAs in the previous year, in analyzing the material risks and opportunities, the Executive Board and \\nSupervisory Board looked at the comparison of the qualitatively and quantitatively aggregated risk \\nportfolio with the updated financial total risk-bearing capacity. The aim was again to determine whether \\nthere was any need for a change in the overall assessment of the risk situation (see below) on this basis.\\nTo ensure maximum transparency and accountability, Beiersdorf’s financial risk-bearing capacity is \\ncalculated based on average net liquidity. The available free cash flow to be used for the development \\nof net liquidity in the multi-period perspective is adjusted solely for the previously deducted \\ninvestments in securities and effects from past M&A transactions. The calculation of risk-bearing \\ncapacity is therefore based on a very conservative approach, as it deliberately does not take into \\naccount potentially significant short-term increases in our liquidity, which could be used in actual crisis \\nsituations.\\nThese increases could include, for example, new and/or increased credit lines, the release of hidden \\nreserves, the sale of fixed assets, individual business units, or own shares from our portfolio, the \\ntemporary suspension of dividend payments, or the reduction of planned investments in the market or \\nin maintaining/expanding our fixed assets. Lastly, for net liquidity and cash flow, we have used only the \\naverage for the last five years, rather than the higher recent figures for 2023.\\nAs a result of comparing the risk situation with risk-bearing capacity, it can be concluded that, over the \\nrelevant observation period of the next two years, the current risk portfolio, revalued during the \\nreporting year, would still not give rise to a financial situation even remotely endangering the Beiersdorf \\nGroup’s continued existence, even given the full and simultaneous occurrence of all the individual risks. \\nDescription of the material risks and opportunities\\nStrategic risks and opportunities\\nAll strategic risks that already existed in 2022 or newly emerged in the 2023 reporting year were again \\nsubjected to a comprehensive review. Where necessary, we adjusted the precise definitions of these \\nrisks and our assessment of their probability and/or impact. This analysis showed no material year-on-\\nyear change in the overall risk situation. Increased risk in some areas, such as climate-related effects \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n158\\nalong the entire value chain, were offset by lower risks in others, for example in relation to the energy \\nsupply situation. In addition, in line with our cautious approach, we have currently completely removed \\nopportunities beyond our medium-term planning from the quantitative net calculation of the risk \\nportfolio. This approach was also taken in the previous year. We have also removed some risk aspects, \\nthat, we regard as part of the day-to-day challenges we continuously face as part of our business model, \\nfrom the definition of strategic risks, since these are generally already captured by our financial \\nplanning. These include, for example, recurring disputes with retailers over pricing, diverse attacks on \\nour brands and products by competitors, and, in particular, the defense of our trademarks and product \\nclaims.\\n1. Reputational risks to brands and the company\\nMaintaining and increasing the value of our major consumer brands with their broad appeal remains \\nof decisive importance to Beiersdorf’s business development. The trust of our customers and, in \\nparticular, of the consumers of our products, is essential to this and cannot be taken for granted. We \\nhave designed our risk management system to fully justify this trust and to provide enduring, \\nsuccessful protection to the value of our brands. We continuously review our internal processes in all \\nareas of the company in order that we can respond appropriately, correctly, and effectively to any \\nevents that could harm or threaten our reputation. Combined with the activities described below in \\nrelation to the quality of our products and overall market image, we expect this to help prevent any \\npotential reputational problems from escalating into critical issues. This applies equally to our \\nbrands and to our company as a whole. Our extensive operational and communication measures in \\nrelation to sustainability, diversity, and other aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) also \\nhelp to limit the risks. In the short term, however, we see a slight increase in net risk as a result of the \\nnew Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, LkSG), despite \\nall the measures already implemented. We categorize the risks to the reputation of our brands and \\nour company as medium and possible overall.\\n2. Critical ingredients\\nFor a clearer distinction and risk assessment, we have presented the risk arising from the use of \\ncritical ingredients separately from general procurement risks in this report. Our research and \\ndevelopment department, with its broad expertise and geographical coverage, ensures that we \\nalways comply with all local legal requirements. It is supported in this by a specialized regulatory \\naffairs function. We are also in permanent dialogue with the relevant authorities so that we can react \\nin good time when changes to product formulation requirements begin to emerge. As a member of \\nthe relevant associations, particularly at the European level, we as a company receive early notice of \\nemerging changes. This also includes our regular dialogue with the key suppliers. In the reporting \\nyear, we made further improvements to our internal process for dealing with critical ingredients. \\nHowever, we note that challenges are growing with the further spread of digital applications and \\nchannels critical of the ingredients used in the cosmetics industry. We continue to categorize the risk \\nas medium and possible. \\n3. Accelerating digitalization\\nThe penetration of digital technology in consumer interaction all along the marketing and sales \\nprocess is still constantly increasing. Beiersdorf therefore continues to work hard at planning and \\nimplementing these interactions in a way that makes them as specific to the target group as \\npossible. We made considerable efforts in precision marketing in 2023, enabling us to invest \\nsignificantly more effectively. At the same time, we put in place organizational measures for even \\nmore integrated working, across all brands, between the functions and IT in close collaboration with \\nthe business. Specifically in e-commerce, we further increased our resourcing to reflect the growing \\nimportance of this channel. Recruiting and retaining suitable talent remains a big challenge. This is \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n159\\nparticularly the case in the field of data analysis, which is crucially important for generating fast and \\naccurate information to guide our actions, including in close dialogue with our customers. Another \\naspect is ensuring the full protection of private data. Our data protection management system, \\nglobally steered and locally implemented, helps us ensure that sensitive data of our company, \\nbusiness partners, and consumers is handled securely at all times. This includes, for example, the \\ndevelopment and use of our social media presence and the development of new software solutions. \\nThese efforts are complemented by clear internal rules of conduct, transparent management \\nstructures, extensive training and monitoring activities, and, in the case of data protection, further \\nwork on global roll-out. In this reporting period, as a result of our various measures, we regard the \\nrisk as medium and possible. \\n4. Growing political and economic uncertainty\\nThe global political situation remained very fraught in the reporting period. Alongside the war in \\nUkraine, the new military conflict in the Middle East is causing uncertainty, as it is unclear whether it \\nwill spread to the wider region. Any such spread could then also have somewhat larger direct \\nimpacts on our business in this region. While the US-China relationship has not deteriorated further \\nin recent months, it continues to represent significant uncertainty. \\nThe outlook for the world economy is difficult to assess overall, since the effects of the very sharp \\ninterest rate hikes of the last 18 months may take some time to be fully reflected in the economic \\nfigures. Highly indebted countries in particular are at high risk if materially higher borrowing costs \\nweigh on current budgets. The same applies to highly indebted individual companies with which \\nBeiersdorf has a direct or indirect business relationship. The real estate crisis in China is potentially a \\nnot-to-be-underestimated factor in this regard. At the same time, Beiersdorf remains geographically \\nrelatively well balanced across all its divisions, without extreme dependency on a particular market. \\nPotential market entries in new countries are comprehensively evaluated in their economic and \\npolitical context. In the case of Russia, care is taken to strictly comply with all sanctions. Nevertheless, \\nwe categorize the risk from the impact of an escalating military conflict or economic crisis in a market \\nrelevant to Beiersdorf as major and possible overall.\\n5. Shortage of raw materials, natural resources, and energy\\nThe general procurement situation has improved in recent months with the easing of COVID-19-\\nrelated restrictions in the global supply chain. This is also evident in falling prices for some important \\nraw materials and packaging materials, even though many categories have not reached the price \\nlevel seen before the pandemic. The same applies to the energy supply, which is regarded as \\nlargely secure at the current time. To allow us to respond swiftly and appropriately to potential \\nfuture supply crises, we are continuously monitoring our markets and suppliers and use appropriate \\ncontract management. Procurement also carefully manages the scope, timing, and frequency of our \\nindividual purchases. Strategic partnerships remain an important element of actively managing our \\nsupplier portfolio, as do internal programs designed to ensure the agility of the supply chain as a \\nwhole and its resilience to disruption. In addition, we are intensively seeking potential cost \\nreductions throughout the value chain as part of the continuation of our broad-based value \\nengineering project. While we see overall positive trends, this area remains one of significant \\nuncertainty. Therefore, we regard the strategic and functional risks in relation to availability and \\nprice trends on the procurement side as medium and possible given the volatile environment.\\n6. Cybersecurity\\nAs part of the review of our strategic risks, we have now returned to reporting the risk from threats to \\nour IT system and the IT systems of our direct business partners as a specific individual risk. This \\nreflects the special and further increasing significance of this risk. This year, the risk of physical \\nunavailability of critical infrastructure excluding IT (chiefly production and storage centers, including \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n160\\ntransport) has been allocated to risks from climate change. With regard to cybersecurity, we \\nsuccessfully defended ourselves again in 2023 against direct and indirect attacks on our own IT \\nsystems. We achieved further improvements in IT infrastructure, particularly in cloud services. We \\nused technical and training-based measures to reduce the particular risk arising from increased \\nworking from home. We also repeated our ISO 27001 certification as an important independent \\nconfirmation of our efforts. In addition, we began to even better protect our operational systems \\nalong the value chain. In light of the growing overall number of threats, we categorize the risk as \\nmedium and possible, despite all the progress achieved.\\n7. Growing ESG requirements\\nRegulatory requirements in this area are constantly increasing. This is due particularly to the \\nEuropean Green Deal, which is implemented through national law, and to the \\nLieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, LkSG). Irrespective of \\nlegal requirements, Beiersdorf has been setting very high goals. This is evident from our own \\nspecific sustainability targets in relation to packaging reduction and avoidance, as well as climate \\nprotection. We are continuing to follow through on implementing our new plastics cycle strategy, \\nfirst announced in 2021, along with our efforts to develop and use sustainable packaging and \\napplications. We have continuously increased our ability to transparently measure progress against \\ninterim targets. In 2023, we again held various events in different formats that were designed to help \\nimprove the awareness and understanding of our employees and managers around the topics of \\nthe environment and sustainability. We also organized a global diversity and inclusion week in 2023 \\nto share our progress and announce ambitious new targets, for example in relation to people with \\ndisabilities. To meet the requirements of the new LkSG, we held training programs primarily on \\naspects related to human rights, both internally and for our suppliers. At the same time, we began \\nassessing and auditing suppliers in relation to this legislation. Given their large number, it will take \\nan extended period of time for this process to cover all our business partners. We anticipate that \\nexpectations on the part of the public, NGOs, and our customers will continue to grow in relation to \\nboth our environmental protection efforts and our actions as a responsible corporate citizen. We \\ntherefore still categorize this risk as major and possible. \\n8. Climate change-related effects along the value chain\\nIn this new risk category, we include all the possible impacts of climate change on our entire value \\nchain – from procuring crucial raw materials and packaging to transporting products to end \\ncustomers. In 2023, we arranged for an extensive external study on risk trends at our own locations \\nbetween now and 2040. The resulting insights are now being translated into appropriate packages \\nof measures. We have also begun to set up continuous monitoring of these risks, including for \\ncritical ingredients. Particular attention is being paid to the water supply at our production sites. We \\nare also constantly updating our emergency plans for critical infrastructure and supplies so that we \\ncan swiftly and fully respond to such situations. At the current time, we categorize this risk as \\nmedium and possible.\\n9. Shortage of talent and skills\\nAnother risk, which we are now upgrading from a functional risk to a strategic risk, relates to the \\ngrowing challenge of recruiting and retaining suitable talent and providing all of our individuals with \\nappropriately swift and comprehensive training on new technologies. This risk affects both our \\nGerman locations and our national companies, particularly in relation to all activities with a strong \\ndigital component. Beiersdorf is competing here not only with other players in our industry but also \\nespecially also with technology firms both large and small. As our most important measure, we \\ntherefore worked urgently in the reporting year on a new employer branding program, which we \\nwill shortly roll out worldwide. We have also stepped up our presence on social media, including by \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n161\\ninvolving all senior managers in our external communications, so as to raise Beiersdorf’s profile and \\nincrease awareness of us as an attractive employer. Partnerships and contacts with universities also \\nserve to build links with qualified potential new employees so that we can prepare them for a career \\nat Beiersdorf through special trainee programs. As in previous years, we reviewed our employees’ \\nsatisfaction using an external, standardized, and anonymous survey, comparing the results both to \\nour own track record and the wider market. The results showed a further slight improvement on the \\nprevious year’s very high satisfaction level. The even greater focus internally on regular, high-quality \\npersonal development meetings and measures should have contributed to this. We have launched \\ntraining programs to tailor employees’ skills to the constantly growing requirements, particularly in \\nrelation to digital technology. These cover general and function-specific skills for which our various \\nacademies are responsible. Given our current competitive strength, we currently assess this risk to \\nbe low and possible.\\n10. Generative artificial intelligence\\nWe have listed this risk, which also represents an incredible opportunity, separately from the risk of \\ngeneral digital acceleration in order to reflect the very rapid pace of developments in this area. As a \\nbrand owner, Beiersdorf is also exposed to particular challenges here. We distinguish between two \\ntypes of risks: firstly, risks arising from the feeding of data to external models, and secondly, risks \\narising from the use of these models’ output. In response to the rapid growth of Chat GPT and \\nsimilar tools, we quickly published binding legal guidance that all Beiersdorf employees must follow \\nwhen using these applications. This is designed in particular to avoid errors in the handling of \\ncopyrights and data protection. We have also put our own Beiersdorf GPT environment in place, \\nwhere the models can be trained securely on our own data. The insights from the first large-scale \\napplication cases are being communicated in such a way that they can be applied to other trials. \\nAlongside research and development, we have begun particularly in marketing to intensively \\nexplore the risks and opportunities as part of a task force. This work is looking at both creative \\nopportunities and productivity-boosting aspects of the new technology. We will continue to work on \\nshaping the framework for the safe use of these tools. At the current time, and partly because the \\napplication cases are still limited, we categorize the risk as low and unlikely. \\nFunctional risks and opportunities\\nWe once again had all functional risks and opportunities evaluated by the global functions during the \\nreporting period. Given the strong overlap with the strategic risks and opportunities in some cases, \\nseparate quantification is not useful for the most part. This particularly applies to the topics of \\nreputation, climate change, sustainability, and procurement. For all these topics, however, we take \\nadditional compensatory measures from a purely functional perspective, which in the case of strategic \\nrisks are limited to the main activities. One example is the use of procurement contracts with protective \\nclauses to reduce the volatility affecting important raw materials and packing materials in uncertain \\nmarkets. \\nWe have classed non-conformity in relation to European capital markets law as only a functional \\nrisk, for example, specifically as it concerns the risk of insider trading or non-compliance in terms of \\nrequired adhoc reporting. Here we have been providing regular, target-specific training since many \\nyears. We also ensure continuous internal information sharing on potentially relevant ad hoc facts. An \\nad hoc committee evaluates and documents the information. We assess the risk to be medium and \\npossible.\\nAnother purely functional risk concerns market risk from investments. Potential default risks relating \\nto the investment of the Group’s liquid funds are limited by only making investments with defined \\nreliable counterparties. Counterparty risk is monitored daily based on ratings and the counterparties’ \\nliable capital as well as continuously updated risk indicators. These parameters are used to determine \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n162\\nmaximum amounts for investments with partner banks and securities issuers (counterparty limits), which \\nare compared with the investments actually made throughout the Group. We have invested most of our \\nliquidity in low-risk investments (such as government/corporate bonds and Pfandbriefe). The investment \\nstrategy, which is documented in writing, is regularly agreed with our internal supervisory body and \\nwith the Supervisory Board. Our risk management process includes looking at the conditional value at \\nrisk so that even extreme market situations can be simulated, understood, and factored into investment \\ndecisions. Our financial risk management is characterized by the clear allocation of responsibilities, \\ncentral rules for limiting financial risks as a matter of principle, and the conscious alignment of the \\ninstruments deployed with the requirements of our business activities. Specific, additional information \\non the extent of the currency, interest rate, default, and liquidity risks described above can be found in \\nNote 29 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, “Additional Disclosures on Financial \\nInstruments, Financial Risk Management, and Derivative Financial Instruments.” The higher interest \\nrates make our cautious strategy easier to implement. We therefore categorize this risk as medium but \\nunlikely.\\nLastly, there is a risk from tax and customs audits in a challenging economic environment, particularly in \\nthe context of some important changes in our global transfer pricing model. Here, we see the specific \\nrisk that local affiliates may not be able to provide the relevant documentation, leading to non-\\nacceptance of our transfer pricing and thus higher taxes. We have therefore stepped up our efforts in \\ntax training and our general communication on tax-related topics. At the same time, we are working to \\ndevelop digital applications for more transparency and common global standards, for example in \\nrelation to tax calculation and documentation. We have also increased the support from third-party \\nexperts on certain issues. Overall, we consider the risk to be major and possible.\\nShort-term operational risks and opportunities\\nAlongside the possible long-term impacts of the many geopolitical and economic uncertainties \\nhighlighted in the strategic risks, we also see ramifications of this volatility for operational risks. Price \\nnegotiations with our customers and the reaction of our consumers to changing prices will play an \\nimportant role. Over the past two years, we have gathered valuable experience that we have used in \\nour analytical tools for simulation purposes. With just a few exceptions, the key assumptions on prices \\nand volumes have therefore already been fully incorporated into the basic plan. We regard the risk of \\neffects exceeding this as improbable and low. \\nThe general risk of a pandemic has been included in our functional risks for the last years along with the \\ncorresponding measures. Our short-term assessment changed in the reporting period to the extent that \\nthe end of pandemic restrictions in many countries enabled positive catch-up effects, especially in \\ncategories such as sun protection and lip care. We have generally included these opportunities in the \\nbasic forecast and do not see any further significant effects in the medium term.\\nThe key net operational risks currently remaining arise exclusively from legal and tax proceedings and \\nfrom tax audits, as in the previous period. These risks are prudently quantified by both internal and \\nexternal experts to the extent possible. Assessing the course and outcome of legal disputes is \\nassociated with considerable uncertainty. Based on the information currently available, no material \\ncharges are expected for the Group that would be considered probable.\\nFurther information and details on the extent of the risks described here can be found in Note 30 of the \\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements, “Contingent Liabilities, Other Financial Obligations, and \\nLegal Risks.”\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n163\\nMonitoring of risks and opportunities\\nFormal monitoring of the strategic and functional risks, including corresponding mitigating measures, \\ntakes place once a year at division board and full Executive Board level and subsequently in the Audit \\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board. Along with adherence to our risk policy principles, this naturally \\nfeeds into every business decision taken at the various levels of our company.\\nIn addition to the above monitoring, operational risks and opportunities are continuously monitored as \\npart of the financial planning, forecasting, and reporting process at the local, regional, and central \\nlevels. This ensures that all sales and earnings effects regarded as relatively likely are directly and \\nappropriately incorporated into our financial reporting, taking into account the measures implemented \\nand planned (e.g., recognition of provisions). This is supplemented by a monthly review of key financial \\nfigures for the Group companies, led by the Group Controlling function together with Risk \\nManagement, Internal Audit, and other relevant controlling functions. The review is designed to enable \\npotentially critical developments to be addressed swiftly and precisely with those involved and \\ncorrective action to be initiated where appropriate.\\nThe latest information on risk development is thus also fed into the management and planning systems \\nof the corporate units regularly throughout the year and becomes part of the decision-making and \\ncontrol processes. By directly integrating the risk inventory and planning process, the risk management \\nsystem is continuously developed further, and risk awareness is embedded throughout the company.\\nSummary of the risk situation\\nLooking at the individual risks, we assess the likelihood of occurrence for the material existing risks to \\nhave increased compared with the previous year only in the case of “reputational risks to brands and \\nthe company.” Given that the three new strategic risks were largely covered by the functional risks in the \\nprevious period, there is no change to the risk situation as a whole. In some cases (digital acceleration, \\nshortages of materials and energy), we have reduced our estimate of the potential financial impact \\nshould the existing strategic risks occur. However, we have added new strategic risks at the same time. \\nWe therefore see no overall need for qualitative repositioning specifically for strategic risks.\\nEven considering the updated estimations, there is currently no fundamental change to our assessment \\nof the overall risk situation. As in the previous year, this assessment was substantiated by comparing the \\ncurrent quantitatively and qualitatively aggregated total risk portfolio with the very conservatively \\ncalculated risk-bearing capacity of the Beiersdorf Group. Risk-bearing capacity has slightly increased, \\npartly due to the Group’s further improved liquidity position. This analysis has confirmed Beiersdorf’s \\nview that, at the current time, neither the Beiersdorf Group nor individual segments of the business are \\nexposed to any risks that could endanger their continued existence.\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n164\\nAccounting-related internal control system\\nThe aim of the accounting-related internal control system is to implement appropriate principles, \\nprocedures, and controls to ensure the correctness and reliability of accounting and financial reporting \\nin the financial statements and management report of the Beiersdorf Group and Beiersdorf AG in line \\nwith the legal regulations and relevant accounting standards.\\nThe scope and orientation of the internal control system have been shaped by the Executive Board \\nbased on the Group-specific requirements. The accounting-related internal control system consists of \\nthe following components: control environment, risk assessment process, control activities, information, \\ncommunication, and monitoring.\\nAn analysis was used to identify the items and positions containing the material risks for the financial \\nstatements. The underlying processes were then assigned to these. Preventive, monitoring, and \\ndetective measures designed to ensure security and control in accounting, information processing, and \\nthe operational functions have been defined Group-wide for these processes. Among other things, the \\nmeasures include the separation of functions, manual and IT-based approval processes using the dual \\ncontrol principle, IT checks, access restrictions and authorization concepts for the IT system, and \\nsystems-based processes for handling Group accounting data. These measures are updated regularly.\\nInternal and external shared service centers provide uniform handling of the core accounting processes \\nat Beiersdorf AG and most of its affiliates. In some cases, they achieve this with the help of fully \\nautomated processes. Standardized IT systems are used to support financial reporting for the affiliates \\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements and consolidation. Procedural instructions, \\nstandardized reporting formats, and IT-based reporting and consolidation processes support financial \\nreporting.\\nThe consolidated financial statements are based on accounting directives specified by Beiersdorf AG. \\nThese guidelines are updated on an ongoing basis through continuous analysis of the relevance and \\nimpact of changes in the regulatory environment.\\nThe accounting process and compliance with the control requirements and accounting directives by the \\ncompanies included in the consolidated financial statements are also regularly reviewed and adjusted if \\nnecessary.\\nIt remains the case that even putting in place appropriate, effective systems does not guarantee the \\ncorrect, complete, and timely recording of information in the accounts with absolute certainty. It is \\nimpossible to entirely rule out personal judgments, erroneous controls, criminal acts, or other \\ncircumstances. Should these occur, they could limit the effectiveness and reliability of the internal \\ncontrol system.\\nAdequacy and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management \\nsystems1\\nIn addition to the accounting-related processes, risk early warning and monitoring systems, and related \\ncontrols, all of which are continuously and systematically audited by internal audit, both centrally and \\nlocally, Beiersdorf also has extensive internal rules, regulations, and processes (including \\ninterdepartmental processes) in all areas material to ensuring proper and legally compliant operations \\n(e.g., in R&D, production and logistics, quality management, and marketing and sales, and especially in \\nthe innovation process, which involves practically all corporate functions). The rules and regulations are \\nregularly communicated and updated as appropriate. Compliance with them is monitored and training \\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n165\\n1 This section of the Combined Management Report is not subject to audit requirements. \\ncontinuously provided. We have developed data collection and control mechanisms for sustainability \\naspects, too. Internal Audit regularly checks that these are being adhered to. We also implemented an \\nintegrated IT system for Risk Management in 2023, bringing together risks in the areas of finance, \\ncompliance, and sustainability. The Executive Board deals with the monitoring and control of these \\nsystems on an ongoing basis, also in close consultation with Internal Auditing. The Executive Board is \\nregularly advised and monitored by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on issues relating to \\nthe appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and \\nthe internal auditing system. This has not recently resulted in any significant need for adjustment or \\nimprovement with regard to these systems. Beiersdorf therefore has no reason to believe that there are \\ninadequate or ineffective internal control and risk management systems in the relevant business areas \\nor in relation to the relevant topics.\\nIndependent monitoring\\nThe supervisory bodies and the Internal Audit department are integrated into the Beiersdorf Group’s \\ninternal control system with audit activities that are independent of the Group’s operations. Internal \\nAudit systematically evaluates the integrity of financial accounting, the effectiveness of the accounting-\\nrelated internal control system and of the risk and opportunity management system, and compliance. \\nAs a process-independent organizational unit, it uses a risk-based approach to reviewing the business \\nprocesses, the systems and controls that have been put in place, and the financial accounting of \\ntransactions. The audit findings are used for ongoing enhancement of the company’s management and \\nof preventive and detective controls. A standardized monitoring system was introduced in 2022, \\nenabling implementation of the controls to be globally monitored, initially in the order-to-cash and \\npurchase-to-pay core business processes. Use of the system was further refined and expanded in 2023.\\nIn accordance with § 317 (4) HGB and § 91 (2) AktG, the Group auditor also evaluates the effectiveness \\nof the risk early warning and monitoring system. Internal Audit and the Group auditor regularly report \\nthe audit results to the supervisory bodies.\\nThe Audit Committee of Beiersdorf AG monitors, in particular, the accounting process and the \\neffectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and the internal audit system. \\nAlongside standard reports, in-depth analyses on fundamental and/or currently relevant issues are \\nregularly used for information purposes.\\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\\nTo the shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Additional Information\\n166')"

As\\na result, our focus is on alternative drive systems ↗ Electromobility,\\ndecarbonisation along the value chain ↗ Carbon emissions, respon-\\nsible sourcing ↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network , resource manage-\\nment in line with the principle of the circular economy ↗ Circular \\nEconomy, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy  as well as compli-\\nance ↗ Compliance and Human Rights .

Infor-\\nmation about the importance of these goals for the BMW Group \\nis provided on our ↗ website. \\nForward-looking statements \\nThis report contains various forward -looking statements con-\\ncerning future developments that are based on the current status \\nof the BMW Group’s assumptions and forecasts. These state-\\nments are therefore subject to a variety of predictable and unpre-\\ndictable risks, uncertainties and other factors, which means that \\nthe actual outcome, including that of the BMW Group’s net as-\\nsets, financial position and results of operations, its development \\nor performance, could differ considerably from those statements. \\nPreparation of non-financial performance figures \\nCertain non -financial performance figures reported by the \\nBMW Group are based on a significant number of estimates and \\nvaluations. Some are complex and subjective in nature, or s ub-\\nject to uncertainty for other reasons. The BMW Group is also con-\\ntinuously updating the policies and procedures used to calculate \\nits non-financial performance figures. It is not always practical to \\napply new policies and procedures to prior reporting periods. Alt-\\nhough the methodology used to calculate indicators is in line with \\nstandard practice, some indicators are not directly comparable \\nwith the values reported by other companies. \\nThe BMW Group is also required to ensure that third parties re-\\nport relevant data to the BMW  Group correctly. These third par-\\nties include independent dealerships - the overwhelming major-\\nity of which report vehicle delivery figures to the BMW Group - \\nand suppliers, which provide the BMW Group with data on the \\nimplementation of agreed measures designed to reduce carbon \\nemissions. \\nStatement on Corporate Governance \\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of BMW \\nAG prepare a yearly combined Statement on Corporate Govern-\\nance in accordance with § 289 f and § 315 d HGB to report on \\ncorporate governance within the BMW Group. The Statement on \\nCorporate Governance is published on BMW  AG’s website at \\n↗ www.bmwgroup.com/ezu. It also includes the Declaration of Com-\\npliance pursuant to § 161 AktG. \\nEditorial comments \\nKey figures presented in the report have been rounded in accord-\\nance with standard commercial practice.

We firmly believe that, thanks to the enthusiasm and precision of our strong \\nworkforce, we will master the challenges ahead and continue to set ourselves apart from \\nthe competition with our wide range of products across all brands and drivetrain types. \\nThe enthusiastic response to the presentation of the BMW VISION Neue Klasse at IAA \\nMobility in Munich clearly demonstrates that the BMW Group is on the right path. \\nREPORT OF THE  \\nSUPERVISORY BOARD  '),\n",

We focused in \\nparticular on driving forward the Group’s electrification strategy and expanding it to include \\nall segments and markets, as well as on implementing the corporate strategies adopted in \\nthe fields of digitalisation and sustainability. At each of the five plenary sessions of the Su-\\npervisory Board (including one two-day meeting), we held detailed discussions with the \\nBoard of Management regarding the Group’s position. The Board of Management also kept \\nthe Supervisory Board well informed regarding any matters of significance outside the \\nframework of formal meetings. Furthermore, I discussed matters personally and on a regu-\\nlar basis with the Chairman of the Board of Management. In addition, the Chairman of the \\nAudit Committee maintained a direct line of contact with the Board of Management member \\nresponsible for Finance as well as with the external auditor’s representatives outside of \\nmeetings. We regularly dealt with internal Supervisory Board issues and personnel-related \\nmatters without the presence of the Board of Management. Our cooperation, both within \\nthe Supervisory Board and its committees and with the Board of Management, was con-\\nducted in a spirit of trust, respect and constructiveness. Detailed documents on the main \\ntopics of each meeting were distributed to the members in advance. Moreover, the share-\\nholder and employee representatives regularly prepared for the meetings in separate pre-\\nliminary discussions.  \\nIn its reports on the BMW Group’s position, the Board of Management kept us well in-\\nformed at each meeting regarding current developments and the Group’s overall perfor-\\nmance. A regular topic of discussion at Supervisory Board meetings was the development \\nof current sales trends based on figures analysed by brand, segment and market region, for \\nboth the BMW Group and its competitors. There was also a keen focus on electrified vehi-\\ncles and an overview of the Group’s key financial indicators and liquidity situation. \\nCorporate strategy, including sustainability, remained high on the Supervisory Board’s \\nagenda. Following an analysis of the current situation in the automotive industry and the \\nramifications of geopolitical developments, the Board of Management presented us with a \\ndetailed strategy for implementing the automotive transformation. The strategy covered the \\ntopics of electrification, digitalisation and sustainability, highlighting in particular the circular \\neconomy concept as a key element of the Group’s sustainable corporate approach. The \\nBMW Group’s ambitious decarbonisation targets for2030 were also reaffirmed. With regard \\nto digitalisation, the Board of Management has placed the NEUE KLASSE at the centre of \\nits strategy, making it the benchmark for a holistic customer experience. The Board of Man-\\nagement also described the digitalisation of key business processes to the Supervisory  \\nBoard. Further topics covered by the Board of Management’s extensive report were market \\nstrategies focusing particularly on China and Europe, the resilience of supply chains, and the \\nholistic, Group-wide performance programme. The report was rounded off with an analysis \\nof the competition and the outlook for the BMW Group’s product portfolio. \\nAt each meeting, the Board of Management updated us on current issues and projects re-\\nlated to strategy development work and implementation. The Board of Management also \\nreported on recent events such as the Group’s successful appearance at the IAA Mobility in \\nMunich, the world premiere of the all-electric BMW iX2 and the BMW iX5 Hydrogen at the \\nJapan Mobility Show, and the implementation of the major internal training programme \\n“Digital Boost”. \\nThe Supervisory Board also closely monitored developments relating to major strategic \\ncollaborations. In 2023, the focus was once again on the Chinese market in particular, with \\nrespect to both the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture and the cooperation with Great \\nWall Motors for the local production of an all-electric MINI. We were also informed about the \\nstatus of the investments in YOUR NOW.  \\nAt Supervisory Board meetings we regularly addressed the topics of sustainability and \\nESG. In a report on recent developments within the Group, the Board of Management in-\\nformed us about the cooperation with IONITY on rapid charging networks, the conversion of \\nBMW Group plants in Oxford and Swindon to enable the manufacturing of all-electric MINI \\nvehicles, and the successful outcome of the local referendum held in Irlbach-Straßkirchen on \\nthe proposed construction of a new BMW Group plant to manufacture high-voltage batter-\\nies, among other things. Furthermore, we were very pleased to note that the BMW Group \\nwas presented with awards for activities relating to its sustainability strategy, conferred by a \\nmanagement consultancy and the magazine “Automobilwoche”, which voted the Group \\nnumber one in the automobile manufacturer category. Moreover, the Fair Pay Innovation \\nLab awarded the BMW Group a gold medal in the category “Fair Pay Leader”. \\nWithin the framework of a presentation on the perception of the sustainability of the BMW \\nGroup and its brands, we examined the objectives of the Group’s corporate ESG strategy in \\ngreater detail and looked at corporate communication regarding sustainability issues as well \\nas their media coverage. Regarding the energy transformation within the BMW Group as \\nwell as decarbonisation at Group sites, we were informed in particular about the further im-\\nprovement of energy management and the strategy involving the transition to renewable \\nenergy sources at the BMW Group’s existing production sites by 2030. We were also pro-\\nvided with reports on plans for new structures where no fossil fuels will be used (such as the \\nplant in Debrecen, where production is scheduled to begin in 2025). '),\n",

Based on a \\nself-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board at 31 De-\\ncember 2023 fully meets the targets stipulated in the diversity concept and the competency \\nprofile. \\nIn the Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code issued in \\nDecember 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board confirmed that they \\nhave complied with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 28 April 2022 with-\\nout exception and will continue to fully comply with them in future. \\nWe also dealt with the Group’s compliance management system in great depth. In his an-\\nnual report, the Chief Compliance Officer presented changes to the structure and content of \\nthe BMW Group’s compliance management system and the revision of compliance regula-\\ntions. The report also addressed the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Dili-\\ngence Act and the handling of individual cases. Moreover, at the Compliance Days in Mu-\\nnich, the Chief Compliance Officer relayed a message from the Chairman of the Board of \\nManagement that set the “tone from the top”, and addressed operational prevention \\nmeasures.  \\nAt each meeting, the Board of Management informed us about the current status of important \\nlegal framework conditions and regulatory projects. These included in particular the EU’s reg-\\nulations regarding fleet carbon emissions in conjunction with the EU’s “Fit for 55” package \\nand the Euro 7 emissions standards.  \\nThe Supervisory Board examined the Board of Management’s remuneration in great de-\\ntail. It reviewed the target structure, maximum remuneration and expected remuneration for \\nthe Board of Management for the financial year 2023, considering in particular the Group’s \\nperformance and the development of remuneration for senior executives and employees in \\nGermany over the past few years. Based on a comparative study conducted by an external \\nindependent remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that the \\nremuneration paid to Board of Management members for the financial year 2022 and the \\ntarget remuneration for 2023 were appropriate. Detailed information on the Board of Man-\\nagement’s remuneration for the financial year 2023 is provided in the Remuneration Re-\\nport. In December 2023, following thorough preparation by the Personnel Committee, we \\nadopted the variable remuneration targets applicable to Board of Management members \\nfor the financial year 2024, taking into account the budget for 2024, the long-term business \\nplan and the BMW Group’s corporate strategy, including its ESG goals. \\nThe Board of Management updated the members of the Supervisory Board biannually on \\nthe current status of the level of attainment of defined financial KPIs and the KPIs for our \\nESG targets, such as deliveries of all-electric automobiles, fleet carbon emissions, attrac-\\ntiveness as an employer, and diversity. \\nIn addition, key topics from the Board of Management’s individual areas of \\nresponsibility were on our agenda. Markets in the USA, Canada and Mexico as well as the \\n“fourth pillar” markets, in particular India, South Korea and Japan, were the subject of an in-\\ndepth sales report. We discussed regional resilience and the growth strategy for these mar-\\nkets in great depth.  \\nIn the highly detailed risk report, we were brought up to date with the structure and working \\nmethods of the risk management system. A key focus of the report was on geopolitical risks, \\nespecially in the areas of purchasing/supply chains and sales markets as well as the \\npresentation of measures to mitigate risk. On the subject of information security with a focus \\non IT security, we were informed about the organisation and functioning of the information \\nsecurity management system and the structure of the IT security risk model, as well as the \\nmeasures derived from it and their effectiveness. The Board of Management also reported \\non the business performance, sector-specific risk profile and current projects of the Finan-\\ncial Services segment. In addition, we received a report on key topics relating to the Group’s \\ntreasury system, such as funding, liquidity management, hedging strategies for price and \\ncurrency risks and the current state of share buyback programmes.  \\nIn conjunction with the report on HR-related strategies, we looked at the BMW Group’s at-\\ntractiveness as an employer, employee performance and commitment, and workforce avail-\\nability. The Board of Management also brought us up to date on the status of the Group’s \\ndiversity concepts and the extent to which targets have been achieved regarding the pro-\\nportion of women employed at various levels.  \\nIn December 2022, the Supervisory Board agreed to the plan to hold the Annual General \\nMeeting 2023 on a virtual basis in accordance with the regulations applicable at the time. In \\nMarch 2023, the detailed concept proposed by the Board of Management was approved. \\nWith regard to the Annual General Meeting 2024, the Board of Management explained the \\nreasons for its decision in favour of the virtual format to the Supervisory Board.

We touched on corporate governance \\nissues such as succession planning for the Supervisory Board, the system for the Board of \\nManagement’s remuneration and the future format of the Annual General Meeting as well \\nas committee work and the Supervisory Board’s handling of geopolitical risks.  \\nWith the BMW Group’s support, Supervisory Board members attended advanced training \\ncourses on various topics during 2023. At our July meeting held at the BMW Group’s Leip-\\nzig plant, the subject of which was “BMW Group Production – Electrified. Digital. Sustaina-\\nble”, we discussed the topic of sustainability in production and energy generation at BMW \\nGroup sites. In September, we took a first in-depth look at the Group’s technology, architec-\\nture and product strategy for the period as of 2025, and more closely at the strategic mod-\\nules of the NEUE KLASSE. The members of the Supervisory Board then tested new BMW, \\nMINI and Rolls-Royce models at the BMW M Driving Academy in Maisach. This involved a \\ndrive on the A8 motorway in the new BMW 5 Series sedan, where we tried out the level 2+ \\nHighway Assistant. In addition, we were presented with BMW brand design vehicles, sup-\\nplemented by a preview of the NEUE KLASSE. A talk by a renowned Chinese economics \\nexpert on the state of the Chinese economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and on \\nopportunities for multinational corporations provided some interesting insights into the Chi-\\nnese market. The Supervisory Board held two hybrid meetings in October and November at \\nwhich the heads of the responsible internal departments and an external consultant pro-\\nvided us with a comprehensive update on non-financial reporting and the EU taxonomy, fo-\\ncusing on implementation by the BMW Group. We also delved more deeply into the complex \\nprocesses involved in implementing and reviewing the ambitious decarbonisation targets \\nwithin the supply chain as well as the main levers for decarbonisation in this area. \\nThe onboarding programme for new Supervisory Board members was also continued in \\n2023. As part of the programme, new members are given an insight into the BMW Group’s \\nkey business areas and planning processes by representatives of internal specialist depart-\\nments. The programme also includes an introduction to the ongoing work of the Supervisory \\nBoard.  \\nIn late 2023, we reviewed the effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory Board and its \\ncommittees with the aid of a questionnaire, and discussed the findings in our subsequent \\nmeeting. Cooperation both within the Supervisory Board and with the Board of Manage-\\nment was unanimously perceived as constructive and trustworthy. In the current financial \\nyear, we intend to act on proposals to explore certain topics in greater depth, such as bat-\\ntery technology and the circular economy concept.  \\nThe Supervisory Board is careful to avoid any conflicts of interest in the course of its deliber-\\nations and decision-making processes. No conflicts of interest occurred in the financial year \\n2023.  \\nDescription of Presiding Board activities and committee work  \\nThe Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. At each \\nsubsequent Supervisory Board meeting, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr Bock, \\nand myself reported in detail on the work of the Presiding Committee and the other commit-\\ntees. Further information on the duties, composition and working methods of the Presiding \\nBoard as well as the various other committees is provided in the Statement of Corporate \\nGovernance on the BMW Group website. \\nUnless a particular committee was responsible, the Presiding Board prepared the topics for \\nthe plenary meetings at its four meetings in cooperation with the Board of Management and \\nsenior heads of department. It also put forward proposals for reporting within the Supervi-\\nsory Board. The Presiding Board focused especially on the corporate strategy and its sus-\\ntainability-related aspects, in addition to longer-term corporate planning. The report on the \\nBMW Group’s position was discussed in detail at every meeting of the Presiding Board. \\nThe Audit Committee convened eight times in total. \\nIn March 2023, the focus was on preparing for the Supervisory Board meeting at which the \\nfinancial statements for the financial year 2022 were discussed and examined. After verify-\\ning the matter of independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory \\nBoard that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) be \\nelected auditor at the Annual General Meeting 2023. There were no indications of conflicts \\nof interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor. '),\n",

The Commit-\\ntee therefore issued the corresponding contracts to PwC following its election at the Annual \\nGeneral Meeting in May 2023. \\nThe Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas. Moreover, it approved \\nthe scope of the non-audit services to be performed, and received regular reports from PwC \\nregarding these services. At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed the quality of the \\naudit in depth on several occasions. In particular, it received a report from the relevant de-\\npartment on the Group’s experience with the audit of the financial statements for the finan-\\ncial year 2022 and on the results of the survey conducted within the Group for this purpose. \\nBased on this report, the auditor’s description of the quality assurance measures under-\\ntaken, and the Audit Committee’s own experience with the auditor, the audit was found be \\nof good quality.  \\nThe Audit Committee also examined the combined Non-financial Statement of BMW AG \\nand the BMW Group for the financial year 2022, which was part of the BMW Group Report \\n2022. The Audit Committee had representatives from PwC explain the results of their audit. \\nWe have again engaged PwC to conduct a “limited assurance” audit of the Non-financial \\n(Group) Statement for the financial year 2023, to the extent that it relates to parts of the \\nmanagement report that are not subject to a ”reasonable assurance” audit. Going beyond \\nthe formal review required by law, the Audit Committee also engaged PwC to audit the con-\\ntents of the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023. \\nThe Quarterly Statements were presented to us for discussion by the Audit Committee prior \\nto their publication by the Board of Management. Representatives of the external auditors \\nwere also present when the Half-Year Financial Report was discussed in early August \\n2023. \\nThe Board of Management informed the Audit Committee regarding the implementation of \\nthe first share buyback programme (which the Audit Committee had already approved in \\n2022), the redemption of the shares on 18 July 2023 and related reduction in share capital, \\nas well as the second share buyback programme resolved by the Board of Management in \\nMay 2023. \\nAt its meeting in July 2023, the Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and appropri-\\nateness of the BMW Group’s internal control system (including the Corporate Audit func-\\ntion), the compliance management system and the risk management system. In the half-\\nyearly risk reports, we addressed the principal risks facing the BMW Group and their classifi-\\ncation. We focused particularly on geopolitical risks and the resulting risk scenarios, espe-\\ncially for supply chains and sales markets, as well as measures to mitigate these risks. \\nWe also addressed the topic of climate-related risks. We regularly monitor the further devel-\\nopment of the internal control system for non-financial reporting with regard to the Group’s \\nsustainability-related targets. \\nThe head of Corporate Audit presented us with the key audit findings and plans for further \\ninternal audits. The Chief Compliance Officer of the BMW Group reported on the structural \\ndevelopment of the compliance management system, the implementation of operational \\nmeasures and further planning. The report also addressed the implementation of the Ger-\\nman Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. In addition, we received a report on the BMW Group’s \\ntax and customs control system from the responsible head of department. \\nIn its report on the audit of over -the-counter derivatives entered into by BMW AG during the \\nfinancial year 2022, the external auditor confirmed to the Audit Committee the effectiveness \\nof the system in place at BMW AG in complying with the regulatory requirements of the Eu-\\nropean Market Infrastructure Regulation.  \\nThe Audit Committee received regular reports on the state and development of significant \\nlegal proceedings and internal investigations and, in individual cases, discussed product- \\nand emissions-related proceedings with external legal advisors brought in for that purpose.  \\nIn its role as a preparatory body, in the course of 2023 the Personnel Committee convened \\nfour times to deliberate on the remuneration of, and succession planning for, the Board of \\nManagement. The review of the appropriateness of the Board of Management’s remunera-\\ntion for the financial years 2022 and 2023 and the determination of the factors for the \\nBoard of Management’s variable remuneration for those years were the subjects of thor-\\nough preparation within the Personnel Committee. The determination of financial and ESG \\ntargets for the Board of Management’s remuneration for the financial year 2024 was also \\ndiscussed in great detail. In addition, the Personnel Committee prepared for the change of \\nremuneration consultant in the financial year 2023. The renewal of the anticipatory resolu-\\ntion on the approval of loans and transactions by BMW Bank GmbH was also on the \\nagenda.  \\nThe Nomination Committee held one meeting in the financial year 2023 in which it dis-\\ncussed the composition of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. Taking \\ninto account the composition requirements resolved by the Supervisory Board and the rec-\\nommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Nomination Committee is-\\nsued recommendations for the Supervisory Board’s election proposals to the Annual Gen-\\neral Meeting to be held in 2024. \\nThe Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the \\nfinancial year under report.

As the Board of Management member responsible for Finance, he played a key role \\nin shaping the development of the BMW Group with his profound expertise, entrepreneurial \\nflair and vision. His work served to further cement the Group’s excellent reputation, both on \\nthe capital market and in the public eye. We are greatly indebted to Nicolas Peter for his out-\\nstanding contribution.  \\nOn 12 May 2023, Walter Mertl was appointed as member of the Board of Management re-\\nsponsible for Finance. He joined the BMW Group in 1998 and was most recently responsi-\\nble for corporate controlling. Mr Mertl has embodied the Group’s commitment to sustainable \\nprofitability during the transformation for many years.  \\nOn 31 October 2023, Pieter Nota left the Board of Management by mutual agreement, also \\nin line with the BMW Group’s succession plans. After becoming the member of the Board of \\nManagement responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales in 2018, Mr Nota was a key fig-\\nure in driving forward the sale of all-electric models and the digitalisation of the customer \\ninterface. He was also responsible for introducing a pioneering agency model for direct \\nsales in selected markets. We wish to thank Pieter Nota for his excellent work and valuable \\ninspiration.  \\nOn 1 November 2023, Jochen Goller was appointed as member of the Board of Manage-\\nment responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. Mr Goller has been at the BMW Group \\nsince 1999 and has headed up activities in the China region since 2018. In Jochen Goller, \\nwe have appointed an internationally experienced sales manager with particular expertise in \\nthe Chinese market to the Board of Management. \\nComposition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory \\nBoard’s committees  \\nThere were no changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board during the past year on \\nthe shareholder representative side. The Annual General Meeting elected Dr Kurt Bock to \\nthe Supervisory Board for a further term of office of approximately four years. He was sub-\\nsequently appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, member of the Presid-\\ning Board and of the Personnel Committee as well as member and Chairman of the Audit \\nCommittee. \\nWith regard to the employee representatives, in January 2023 Dr Martin Kimmich was ap-\\npointed to succeed the departing long-serving First Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory \\nBoard, Manfred Schoch, for his remaining term of office. Dr Kimmich has been Chairman of \\nthe Munich Works Council and the BMW AG Works Council since 2022. \\nDisclosure of attendance at meetings by individual members \\nThe attendance rate at Supervisory Board meetings was 99%, and 100% for the meetings \\nheld by the various committees and the Presiding Board. The meetings were held in person, \\nwith individual members participating virtually only in justified exceptional cases. Three meet-\\nings of the Audit Committee that dealt with the quarterly reports were held as hybrid meet-\\nings, with individual members connected by either telephone or video call as planned.

PwC initially conducted a \\nreview of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Man-\\nagement Report for the first half of 2023 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee. \\nNo issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial \\nStatements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance \\nwith the applicable provisions in all material respects. \\nThe Company Financial Statements and the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG for the \\nfinancial year ended 31 December 2023, including the Combined Management Report, on \\nwhich PwC has issued unqualified audit opinions, were authorised by the Board of Manage-\\nment on 12 March 2024. These audit opinions were signed for the fifth consecutive finan-\\ncial year by independent auditor Petra Justenhoven (Wirtschaftsprüferin) and, for the second \\ntime, by Michael Popp (Wirtschaftsprüfer) as the auditor responsible for the performance of \\nthe engagement.  \\nAt its meeting held on 29 February 2024, the Audit Committee initially gave in-depth con-\\nsideration to the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements and \\nthe Combined Management Report (including the combined Non-financial (Group) State-\\nment and the information on the EU taxonomy) as well as the draft version of the auditor’s \\nlong-form reports.  \\nImmediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Com-\\npany and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2023 and the Combined Man-\\nagement Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement) to the Supervi-\\nsory Board. The auditor’s long-form audit reports were also submitted to the Supervisory \\nBoard in a prompt manner. In order to facilitate preparations, drafts of these documents had \\nalready been made available to the Supervisory Board in advance. \\nAt its meeting held on 13 March 2024, the Audit Committee diligently examined and delib-\\nerated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of \\nthe Supervisory Board on 14 March 2024.  \\nAt the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided a detailed explanation \\nof the reporting documents submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. \\nThe representatives of the external auditor reported on the main findings of their audit and \\nanswered questions put to them by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory \\nBoard, partially without the presence of the members of the Board of Management. Both \\nthe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board gave meticulous consideration to the key \\naudit matters and the related audit procedures. \\nThe representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system \\nestablished by the Board of Management is capable of identifying at an early stage any de-\\nvelopments that might threaten the Company’s going-concern status. They also confirmed \\nthat no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system \\nwere identified with regard to the financial reporting process. \\nIn the course of their audit work, they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the con-\\ntents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 of the German Stock Corporation \\nAct (AktG) jointly issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. \\nBased on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory \\nBoard, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the final result \\nof this examination, no objections were raised. At our meeting held on 14 March 2024, we \\naccordingly approved the Group and Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the fi-\\nnancial year 2023. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December \\n2023 have therefore been adopted. \\nFurthermore, in both the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we examined the \\nBoard of Management’s proposal to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of \\n€ 6.00 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend and € 6.02 for each \\nshare of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend and to transfer the remaining amount \\nto other revenue reserves. We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore ap-\\nproved it. \\nBased on the preparatory work of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the \\nBoard of Management jointly prepared the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 \\nin accordance with § 162 AktG. At the request of the Audit Committee, PwC reviewed the \\ncontents of the Remuneration Report, reported to both the Audit Committee and the Super-\\nvisory Board on the results of the review, and confirmed that the Remuneration Report com-\\nplies with the financial reporting provisions contained in § 162 AktG in all material respects.  \\nThe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also carefully examined the combined \\nNon-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2023. Following an in-\\ndepth explanation of the statement by the Board of Management, representatives of PwC \\npresented the key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the \\nmembers of the Supervisory Board. Based on the “limited assurance” audit performed by \\nPwC on those parts of the Management Report and certain sustainability disclosures in the \\nintegrated BMW Group Report 2023 that were not subject to a reasonable assurance en-\\ngagement, PWC issued an unqualified opinion, signed for the second time by Michael Popp \\n(Wirtschaftsprüfer) and for the first time by Annette Fink.

Entrepreneur Herbert Quandt laid the foundation for this many years ago. \\nHis family’s next generation and all of us who work at the Company are following his legacy. \\nIn his spirit, the Company and its employee representatives work together – negotiating \\nfirmly, but always focused on finding solutions for the future. That, too, is our lived BMW cul-\\nture. \\nAll these things make your Company strong and resilient. This is especially true in the cur-\\nrent conditions, where we face a variety of  extremely demanding requirements in individual \\nregions of the world, with geopolitical uncertainty and entirely new challenges constantly \\nemerging. We provide a substantial response to all these things. \\nMore than 150,000 associates worldwide carry your Company forwards through their hard \\nwork and dedication every day. They all value your commitment and your loyalty to the \\nBMW Group as shareholders. \\nYour Company intends to stay on track for success. \\nOur business model – individual premium mobility in its different forms and in line with re-\\ngional requirements – continues to offer substantial potential for achieving profitable growth \\nand gaining market share. \\nWe are taking advantage of these opportunities in our rolling strategic approach and our long-\\nterm corporate planning. What sets us apart is that we make conscious decisions, that are \\nconsistently based on facts, empirical findings and well-founded analysis – not driven by the \\ncurrent “zeitgeist” or short -term hypes. And, of course, it takes experience and sometimes \\nalso common sense. \\nOur BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad brands enjoy an excellent reputation \\nworldwide. Our products don’t just get people from A to B; they touch hearts and spark \\nemotions. Our customers experience their mobility in a very individual way. To achieve this, \\nwe are making mobility more human, more intelligent and more sustainable. \\nA glance in the rear-view mirror shows that we are certainly capable of doing this: BMW has \\novercome difficult situations many times in the past. This certainty has shaped our self-con-\\nfidence for 108 years. Your Company has constantly reinvented itself – taking bold leaps in \\ninnovation at exactly the right time.  \\nTiming is key in whether innovations gain traction and the Company stays relevant, but it is \\nalso clear that: \\nThe future is always ahead of us. And we are prepared! \\nWe know where we are headed at all times and we know what we need.

All-\\nelectric vehicles are projected to account for half of our global deliveries before 2030. We \\nare right on track. \\nYour investment in the BMW Group must be worth it.  \\nYour Company is robust and financially strong. Our Automotive EBIT margin for financial year \\n2023 was within our upwardly adjusted target range of 9.0 to 10.5%.  As you know, we are \\nstill targeting a range of 8 to 10% in the long term. At Group level, our EBT margin for 2023 \\nof 11% exceeded our strategic target of 10%.  \\nOur profitability puts us in a position where we can once again pay you an attractive dividend. \\nWe are making major investments in our future. The same applies to 2023 as well as to the \\ncurrent financial year. Our R&D spending focus on our products, further electrification and \\ndigitalisation of our line-up and automated driving. At the same time, we are investing in the \\nNEUE KLASSE mega-project, our modular kits, construction of high-voltage battery produc-\\ntion facilities in various markets, and the new plant in Debrecen, to name just a few examples. \\nYour Company is going to profit noticeably from all this in the coming years. \\n  \\n‘‘We make conscious decisions, that are  \\nconsistently based on facts.’’ '),\n",

As anticipated, we not \\nonly posted solid year-on-year growth, but also achieved a new all-time high at Group level. \\nOur brands performed very well individually , too, with new all-time highs for BMW, BMW M, \\nRolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad. Despite the model changeover due to the extensive realign-\\nment of the brand, MINI reported higher sales than the previous year. \\nOur core BMW brand maintains its leading position in the global premium segment. In \\nMarch 2024, BMW was ranked number one in the US by the consumer portal “Consumer \\nReports”. This independent platform compared test ratings, reliability, customer satisfaction \\nand safety criteria among 34 automotive manufacturers. Four BMW models even earned \\nthe “Green Choice” environmental seal for being among the vehicles in the United States \\nwith the lowest emissions. \\nDynamic growth for our all-electric models. \\nIn addition to significant growth in the luxury class and upper premium segment, the strongest \\nimpetus for growth last year came from our all-electric vehicles. We sold over 375,000 BEVs \\n– which is about 75% more than the previous year. This means that, by the end of 2023, all-\\nelectric vehicles made up around 15% of our total sales.\\nThis is also reflected in our share of the global BEV market: at 4.1%, it is already significantly \\nhigher than our share of the total global market, which remains stable at 3.3%. \\nBy the end of 2024, we will have more than 15 all- electric models in our line- up across all \\nbrands, from MINI to BMW to Rolls-Royce. All of this speaks for our fresh and highly attractive \\nproduct range – across all brands, all segments and all drive technologies. \\nIn 2023, all our new vehicles went into production or were released onto the market, as \\nplanned, including the new BMW 5 Series and the new BMW X2 with the all-electric variants, \\nthe i5 and iX2. MINI also presented two models from the all -new MINI family at the IAA  \\nMOBILITY: the Cooper 3-door and the Countryman. \\nBMW Motorrad celebrated its centenary in late September of last year, with Federal Chancel-\\nlor Olaf Scholz attending the anniversary celebrations at the Berlin-Spandau plant. There \\nwere two main highlights: the inauguration of the BMW Motorrad Welt – the counterpart to \\nour BMW Welt in Munich, as a delivery and visitor centre – and the premiere of the R 1300 \\nGS.

General \\nrecognition of our strategy keeps on growing since we continue to present measurable suc-\\ncesses in decarbonisation. \\nYour Company outperformed the EU CO2 fleet target by 20%. \\nAs in previous years, we not only met the EU CO2 fleet target for the use phase in 2023, but \\nsignificantly overfulfilled it: the BMW Group’s numbers came in at 26.5 grams significantly \\nbelow the applicable limit for the reporting year of 128.6 grams of CO 2 per kilometre. We \\ntherefore ended up below the CO2 limit set for BMW by more than 20%. \\nAs you can see, we are continuing the positive trend of recent years, through further electri-\\nfication of our vehicle portfolio and by using innovative Efficient Dynamics technologies \\nthroughout our entire fleet. \\nTechnology openness in BMW 5 Series and 5 Series Touring. \\nFollowing on from the new BMW 5 Series Sedan, which has been available since late 2023, \\nthe new BMW 5 Series Touring is another perfect example of how our comprehensive tech-\\nnological expertise works in practice.  \\nThe Touring, which will be launched this spring, is especially popular in Europe. Here, also, \\ncustomers will have four drive concepts to choose from: all-electric, plug-in hybrid or highly \\nefficient diesel and petrol engines with 48-volt mild-hybrid technology. BMW is where Touring \\nmeets e-drive. No one else in this segment offers a vehicle like the all-electric BMW i5 Tour-\\ning, with an electric range of over 500 kilometres.  '),\n",

Both M variants come with \\nan impressive partially electrified drivetrain. \\nOur plug-in hybrid models remain an important element of our drivetrain portfolio. Current \\nGen5 battery technology already enables an attractive range. Plug-in hybrids also provide a \\nboost to e-mobility that should not be underestimated. Many customers discover the ad-\\nvantages of electric driving for the first time this way. \\nEarly in 2024, we passed the milestone of two million electrified vehicles sold. This includes \\nboth pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. \\nWe are already testing hydrogen drivetrains in everyday situations. \\nWe have been testing the BMW iX5 Hydrogen on the road in selected countries under every-\\nday conditions since last year. Our pilot fleet’s world tour has raised awareness of the role \\nhydrogen can play in the energy transition – not just for mobility, but ind ustry-wide. We see \\nhydrogen as a possible alternative drive technology in the mid to long term.  \\nOur vehicles performed well under various climate and traffic conditions – and the public re-\\nsponse has been overwhelmingly positive. This is understandable, since hydrogen fuel cell \\ndrivetrains combine the best of both worlds: the advantages of an emissions-free e-drive, \\nwith the fast refuelling people are used to. We also demonstrated this at the COP28 UN Cli-\\nmate Change Conference in Dubai. Your Company is supporting the growth of the hydrogen \\neconomy worldwide, as well as locally, including expansion of infrastructure networks for \\nhydrogen filling stations.\\nWe aim to continue our profitable growth. \\nAll our brands and drivetrain variants help assure the continued profitable growth of your \\nCompany. We expect to see significant double-digit growth in sales of our BEV models again \\nin 2024. We continue to steer the e-mobility ramp-up smartly and precisely in line with differ-\\nentiated demand in all regions of the world. \\nWe presented our latest models to members of the international media in Portugal in Febru-\\nary 2024. Shortly afterwards, we invited 1,500 retailers from 30 European countries to Am-\\nsterdam for a glimpse of the future, including the new BMW 1 Series and the latest edition of \\none of our top-selling individual models, the BMW X3. \\nThe new MINI models for 2024 include the next member of the new MINI family, the Aceman, \\nwhich will celebrate its world premiere in April 2024. This electric -only crossover in the pre-\\nmium compact-car segment will also bring a massive leap in digitalisation. MINI has a de-\\nvoted community and creates a unique sense of life and community spirit.  The new MINI \\nfamily is produced at our Chinese joint venture, Spotlight, in Oxford, UK, and, for the first time, \\nin Germany, at the Leipzig plant. At Rolls-Royce, Spectre is the first battery-electric model to \\nbecome available. Rolls- Royce has long been a standout and unrivalled in the ultra- luxury \\nclass with exclusive models. \\nWith the CE02, BMW Motorrad is already releasing its second all-electric model onto the mar-\\nket, as well as the second M motorcycle model, the M 1000 XR, and the R 1300 GS Adven-\\nture. That means there will be no fewer than three new top models at BMW Motorrad. They \\nall illustrate the breadth of the product line -up. Everyone – and that also applies to me as a \\nmotorcycle rider – can find the right bike for their needs at BMW Motorrad. \\nNEW RETAIL: direct sales as win-win for everyone involved. \\nIn January 2024, we sold and delivered our first vehicle, a MINI, through our new sales sys-\\ntem. We have already switched the MINI brand to a direct sales model in Poland, Italy and \\nSweden, with other European markets to follow. In China, we have been successfully using \\nthis approach for MINI since 2023. \\n‘‘We are steering the e-mobility ramp-up smartly \\nand precisely in line with demand in all regions of the world.’’  \\n \\n '),\n",

This will create a win-win  situation for everyone involved. Our retail \\npartners and their profitable business model will remain an essential pillar of these new \\narrangements. \\nAutomated driving: the car as digital companion. \\nIt goes without saying that we offer our customers the newest innovations and the latest, \\nstate-of-the-art technology. Over-the-air upgrades ensure that every one of our vehicles is \\nalways digitally up to date. The art lies in mast ering this process: we anticipate far in advance \\nwhat our customers are going to need and want in five to ten years’ time. That is how we \\nensure they get the best overall package from us. This is our aspiration. \\nAnd that is why we keep setting benchmarks: \\nThe BMW 5 Series Sedan is the first car in Germany to be approved for partially automated \\ndriving at speeds up to 130 km/h on motorways. The BMW Highway Assistant allows the \\ndriver to take their hands off the steering wheel while driving longer distances. We also \\nadded a completely new feature: Active Lane Change Assistant with eye confirmation. This \\nallows the vehicle to make an automated lane change without a steering intervention: a \\nglance in the exterior mirror is all that is required. \\nTaking your hands off the steering wheel and even being able to temporarily turn your atten-\\ntion away from the road – that is Level 3 highly automated driving. From March 2024 on-\\nwards, our customers will be able to do precisely this in the models of the new BMW 7 Series. \\nBMW Personal Pilot L3 is the name of this new function, which takes over driving in certain \\nd\\nefined traffic situations and manages speed, distance and lane tracking autonomously.  \\nFor us, the highest le vel of premium functionality g oes hand in hand with maximum safety \\nfor our customers and all road users. We therefore opened the Future Mobility Development \\nCentre in Sokolov in the Czech Republic in summer 2023, where we are testing automated \\ndriving and parking functions, up to and including fully automated driving (Level 4). At this \\nlocation, we are able to simulate virtually all situations that occur in road traffic and thus en-\\nsure the maturity of our technical solutions. \\nNEUE KLASSE – vision becomes reality. \\nWith its spectacular Vision Vehicles, your Company showcases time and again indicates the \\ndirection in which we are taking mobility, in line with the major global topics of the future – \\nthrough bold leaps in innovation and responsible action. This is what our NEUE KLASSE \\nmega-project represents in a unique way.  \\nLast year, there were two major milestones: at the CES in Las Vegas at the start of the year, \\nwe unveiled our BMW i Vision Dee, full of digital innovations. Then, in September, at the IAA \\nMOBILITY, we presented our BMW VISION Neue Klasse. No other car at the IAA MOBILITY \\nreceived as much media coverage and attention as the BMW VISION Neue Klasse. \\nWe also presented this Vision Vehicle to our associates at an exclusive evening event. The \\ninterest was huge. Up to 700 associates from across Germany were selected by lottery to \\nattend the event live with a companion. Another 25,000 watched the live stream or the re-\\ncording of the event. That is a sixth of our global workforce. I see that as genuine interest in \\nour joint future project, the NEUE KLASSE. \\n‘‘We anticipate far in advance what our \\ncustomers want. That is how we ensure \\nthey get the best overall package from us.’’'),\n",

The innovations of the NEUE KLASSE will benefit all future BMW \\nmodels. \\nWe are preparing to launch the NEUE KLASSE onto the market at an unprecedented pace \\nfrom 2025 onwards, with six models within just 24 months of the start of production. We \\nshowed the scope of the NEUE KLASSE in a very concrete way for the first time at the BMW \\nGroup Annual Conference on 21 March 2024. Its offering ranges from sporty sedan to X \\nmodel. The BMW VISION Neue Klasse and our newest Vision Vehicle – the BMW VISION \\nNeue Klasse X – represent these two bookends. \\nI can promise you that both Vision Vehicles will be on the market soon in a very similar form. \\nIn-between these two models, there is plenty of room for everything that will define the BMW \\nbrand in the future. \\nThe Board of Management members already had the chance to drive prototypes of the \\nNEUE KLASSE. What a fantastic driving experience! The first camouflaged prototypes are \\nalready being tested on the roads and we will be building the first pre-production vehicles \\nbefore the end of the year. \\nAfter the official start of production, in 2025, at our newest BMW plant in Debrecen, Hun-\\ngary, the NEUE KLASSE will also come off the production line at our oldest plant in Munich \\nfrom 2026, with other locations worldwide to follow. Incidentally, one out of every two \\nBMWs leaving the Munich production line is already fully electric today. From 2027 on-\\nwards, our more than 100-year-old main plant will build only electric vehicles. \\nMobility is movement – and movement requires energy and functioning supply \\nchains. \\nWe are talking here about powerful, innovative and sustainably produced battery cells – in \\nother words, high-voltage batteries. In the models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will be using our \\nnewly developed round lithium-ion battery cells, which have been optimised for the new ar-\\nchitecture, for the very first time.  \\nOur sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology represents an enormous leap in technology, \\ncompared to the previous generation: we are increasing energy density by more than 20 %, \\nimproving charging speed by up to 30% and boosting range by around 30% – at the same \\ntime as lowering costs. We are also reducing CO 2 emissions from cell production by up to \\n60%. \\nFor both basic research and development of mass-manufacturing processes for high-voltage \\nbatteries, your Company is relying on in -house expertise. We want to understand every as-\\npect of the high-voltage battery. To do so, we have created the necessary conditions for this \\nwith the Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich and the Cell Manufacturing Competence \\nCentre in Parsdorf, Bavaria, enabling us to span all value creation processes involved in cell \\nproduction; this is a crucial step for us. \\nThe Gen6 batteries for our plants in Bavaria will be supplied from our planned new location \\nin Irlbach-Straßkirchen from 2026 onwards. Before embarking on the building project, we \\nsought frank and open dialogue with local residents. We were very pleased that they voted \\nstrongly in favour of our site and see this as confirmation of our efforts. \\nYour Company is building production facilities for BMW high-voltage batteries not just in \\nLower Bavaria, but all over the world – always in close proximity to our vehicle plants in \\nHungary, the US, Mexico, China and Thailand. Our strategic “local for local” approach also \\nguarantees short transport distances for high-voltage batteries and secures our supply \\nagainst unforeseen events in different regions of the world. \\nWith our “i Suppl y Chain” strategy, we are ensuring resilient, excellent and digital supply \\nchains in all areas. Our plants worldwide need supplying with 36 million parts every day – at \\nthe right time, in the best quality and in the right quantity. For the digitalisation of our supply \\nchains, we are relying on Catena-X, a shared data ecosystem for automotive manufacturers, \\nsuppliers and subcontractors, as well as recycling companies in the future. This digital collab-\\noration increases efficiency and transparency – for example, around the carbon footprint and \\noptions for tracing components and raw materials. \\n‘‘The NEUE KLASSE is much more than just a \\nsingle car. It is an entirely new generation of BMW models - -- all of them developed with an \\nall-electric heart, fully digitalised and with a \\nclear focus on sustainability.’’'),\n",

Your Company did exceptionally well to make it into the top 10, \\nand was, in fact, the highest -ranked automotive manufacturer in the global comparison. \\nThree criteria were decisive for this assessment: revenue growth, sustainability and employee \\nsatisfaction. These three are not opposing factors but belong together. \\nWith regard to employees: in autumn 2023, we once again asked our global team to share \\ntheir opinion. For the first time, all 150,000 associates worldwide were able to take part. \\n84% took advantage of this opportunity. \\nThe vote was unequivocal: 85% support our strategy – our BMW way. Another very clear \\nmajority of 88% said they would recommend our Company as an employer. 93% are proud \\nto work for the BMW Group.  \\nIs there any better foundation for continuing on our successful course together? \\n2023 was another strong team effort. \\nPersonally, and on behalf of the entire Board of Management, I would like to thank all our \\nassociates. Everyone made a valuable contribution. I would also like to thank all our custom-\\ners worldwide, our retail organisation and our suppliers.  \\nAll of us at BMW are united by a can-do spirit: think ahead – perform – succeed! \\nDear Shareholders, \\nOur business environment will again be dominated by a great many challenges this financial \\nyear, including weak economic development in several markets, the price development in the \\nautomotive sector, high interest rates and the uncertainty created by geopolitical shifts. \\nThat is why it is so decisive that we recognise and systematically exploit our opportunities. It \\nis important to me that all of us at the BMW Group approach our tasks with self-belief, confi-\\ndence and the necessary grit. I travel the world a lot, visiting our markets and facilities. \\nEverywhere I go, I see how valuable and important individual mobility is in many people’s \\neveryday lives. \\nCourage, pride in performance and resilience. \\nThat is what makes your Company different. We dare to chart our own course, even in turbu-\\nlent times; we are able to withstand the headwinds, as long as we are convinced that we are \\non the right path. \\nYour Company is a high-performance organisation. That is why we once again have ambi-\\ntious plans for 2024: on the automotive side, 14 new models will go into production and \\nBMW Motorrad will release a further 12 new models – not to mention numerous model up-\\ndates and engine variants. We have never postponed a launch and we will not waver from \\nthis. \\nAll of this shows that we are continually laying the foundation for our future success. That is \\ncontinuous progress. In other words: ↗ DRIVING THE NEXT ERA. \\nThat is why the following applies to your Company: \\nStrong today – strong tomorrow. \\nOliver Zipse \\nChairman of the Board of Managemen\\n‘‘Our customers experience their mobility in a \\nvery individual way.

This combination re-\\nsults in a comprehensive spectrum of topics: \\n— The Paris Climate Agreement and climate neutrality goal of \\nthe BMW Group  \\n— Emissions limits with a focus on technological diversity in \\nterms of drivetrain technologies and vehicle concepts  \\n— Hydrogen as a potential ener gy storage for electric \\ndrivetrain systems  \\n— Circular design and use of secondary materials (particularly \\nin relation to battery recycling) \\n— Active crisis management regarding the geopolitical \\nsituation and energy supply \\n— Supply of critical raw materials \\n— Compliance with statutory due diligence obligations in \\nsupply chains, particularly environmental and social \\nstandards and respect for human rights, especially \\nregarding the procurement of raw materials for \\nelectromobility applications \\n— Sustainable financing , EU taxonomy and sustainability \\nreporting standards, greenwashing \\n— Social responsibility for employees \\n— Increased transparency in the sustainability indicators \\nprovided in product information \\n— Establishment of a new site in Germany to assemble high -\\nvoltage batteries \\nBMW Group Xchange \\nThe BMW Group XC hange encompasses the well -established \\nforms of events organised by the Group, such as the BMW Group \\nDialogues and the rad°hub, providing the appropriate platforms \\nto encourage dialogue with a variety of target groups. The for-\\nmats selected usually take place several times a year. The results \\nof these stakeholder dialogues are documented and incorpo-\\nrated in the Group’s strategic considerations. ↗ GRI Index: 2-12 \\nParticipation in public policy development and work in \\nassociations \\nThe BMW Group maintains an active, open and transparent dia-\\nlogue with decision makers and representatives of politics, trade \\nunions, associations and non-governmental organisations \\n(NGOs), with a view to playing a constructive and transparent  \\nrole in helping to shape the general political framework to the ex-\\ntent that it concerns the Group’s business activities. The \\nBMW Group is a member of numerous associations in various \\ncountries. As a rule, membership and commitment are voluntary. \\nIn certain cases, however, participation may also be based on \\nstatutory requirements. \\nThe BMW Group’s involvement in associations ranges from \\nboard memberships in association bodies to active participation \\nin working groups as well as simple observer status. Our goal is \\nto coordinate our approach with the respective associations on \\npositions regarding relevant strategic issues. If the BMW Group \\nidentifies discrepancies between association and Company po-\\nsitions, the Company works with the association concerned with \\nthe aim of bringing the positions closer together. The BMW \\nGroup sees its role as sharing its corporate opinions as part of \\nthe associations’ policy-forming process. In this way, we are able \\nto participate in discussions on key strategic issues such as cli-\\nmate protection, human rights, the circular economy, decarboni-\\nsation with a view to achieving the Paris climate targets, and \\ntransparent supply chain management. \\nA comprehensive overview of the BMW Group’s key political po-\\nsitions and activities can be found at ↗ Advocacy, a new section of \\nthe website made available in May 2023 which goes beyond and \\nreplaces the previous Climate Commitment Report. \\nDIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS  '),\n",

The \\nBMW Group kept investors, analysts and rating agencies up to \\ndate again in 2023 with its regular quarterly and annual report-\\ning. The BMW Group has stepped up its communication with in-\\nvestors who consider sustainability criteria in their investment \\ndecisions in the past few years and now meets this group’s in-\\nformation needs with in-person and virtual ESG conferences, in \\naddition to individual and group meetings. The Group’s commu-\\nnication focused on the further development of the business \\nmodel, digitalisation and other technology trends in the automo-\\ntive industry, sustainability in the supply chain and the ramp-up \\nof electromobility. In 2023, the Group also focused on measuring \\nthe carbon footprint of its pension plan assets in the UK and Ger-\\nmany, and validating the data available for this purpose. The \\n↗ TCFD Report was created for the UK BOPS* Plan, reiterating the \\ntarget to achieve carbon neutrality for the scheme’s asset port-\\nfolio by 2050. \\nThe volume of non-liquid pension plan assets invested in our var-\\nious impact funds continues to grow according to schedule, with \\nseveral new subscriptions exercised in the form of fund-based \\ninvestments. The investments made to date in this area relate \\nnot only to climate protection, but also to other Sustainable De-\\nvelopment Goals (SDGs) set out by the UN. Investments that \\nhave a beneficial effect on the climate are at the forefront of the \\nimpact funds. \\nOutlook \\nThe BMW Group will continue to interact closely and construc-\\ntively with its stakeholders and develop existing dialogue oppor-\\ntunities in 2024, and will continue to maintain active dialogue \\nwith capital market players such as investors, financial analysts \\nand rating agencies. As in previous years, our activities will in-\\nclude direct dialogue as well as participation in in-person and vir-\\ntual ESG conferences. \\nMoreover, plans are in place for the coming year to expand the \\nscope of recording the carbon emissions associated with those \\ninvestments, with the primary aim of reliably assessing and \\ntransparently documenting the compatibility of our investments \\nwith the climate goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement. To the \\nextent possible, our aim is to take account of non-liquid invest-\\nments in the Group’s reporting on sustainability, or at least for all \\nsuch investments to be reviewed from a sustainability perspec-\\ntive. \\nThe Board of Management’s collaboration with \\nstakeholders to identify and manage impacts \\nThe Board of Management keeps up to date with stakeho lder \\nfeedback and positions through a variety of channels, for exam-\\nple in regular Board meetings, in direct dialogue with stakeholder \\ngroups (such as investors or political decision makers) and \\nthrough briefings conducted by BMW Group departments, espe-\\ncially prior to attending major events such as OECD conferences \\nor the Group’s Annual General Meetings. The Chairman of the \\nSupervisory Board also maintains regular contact with stake-\\nholders. The members of the Supervisory Board attend the An-\\nnual General Meeting, and many of them also interact with stake-\\nholders as part of their other activities and mandates. \\nApproach taken to engage stakeholders \\nThe BMW Group continuously communicates with a large num-\\nber of different stakeholder groups at all locations and in all mar-\\nkets.

Software updates with \\nfurther functional developments are expected and generally be-\\ncoming standard. ↗ Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation \\nAlongside digitalisation, development of automated/autono-\\nmous driving remains a key expectation for the future of mobility. \\nInitial offerings of Level 4* features are expected to launch in the \\nmarket before 2030, although widespread adoption is expected \\nto occur only after 2030. ↗ Products \\nThe acceleration of electromobility worldwide continues to be an \\nimportant prerequisite on the path to climate neutrality, although \\nthe pace of adoption is expected to vary regionally. In the long \\nterm, there will be a parallel range of electric vehicles and com-\\nbustion engine vehicles available worldwide. However, the num-\\nber of all-electric models in the automotive industry as a whole is \\nexpected to continue to increase. Addressing remaining uncer-\\ntainties, including regulations, the swift and widespread develop-\\nment of charging infrastructure and the availability of raw mate-\\nrials will be essential for the future expansion of this sector. It is \\nnecessary to increase the pace at which capacities are expanded \\nin order to meet the ever-increasing demand for climate-neutral \\nand green energy across industries. The share of regenerative \\nenergies in the energy mix is on the rise, increasing the volatility \\nof the entire energy supply and making it increasingly difficult to \\nmaintain the stability of networks. Due to these factors and the \\nlimited capacities of distribution networks, every effort needs to \\nbe continued to ensure that elec tromobility is a long -term suc-\\ncess. ↗ Electromobility  \\nEnvironment \\nAs governments around the world work to transpose the goals of \\nthe Paris Climate Agreement’s carbon reduction targets into na-\\ntional laws, an ambitious orientation towards climate policy will \\nserve as an important basis for successful action for businesses. \\nIt is equally vital to prepare for the consequences of current and \\nanticipated changes brought about by climate change, which \\ncreate a tangible urgency to take action. The role of hydrogen as \\nan energy source is set to undergo a fundamental shift, propelled \\nby the global imperative for decarbonisation.  \\nBusiness \\nBusiness and the environment are closely linked and influence \\neach other. Thus, alongside carbon emissions, resource effi-\\nciency will also gain in importance. The demand for secondary \\nmaterials and recycling is also rising, for instance, due to quota \\nrequirements. Simultaneously, this development is giving rise to \\ncross-industry initiatives and opportunities  for new business \\nmodels. ↗ Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy \\nCompetition among various political systems is a dominating \\nforce in international politics, influencing changes in international \\ntrade flows using instruments like sanctions, tariffs and subsi-\\ndies. The need to secure supply chains is intensifying due to the \\ndual challenges of climate change and geopolitical risks. \\nPolitics \\nPolitics and regulations are narrowing the scope for action across \\nthe entire automotive value creation model. There is an increas-\\ning variety of legislation in all regions of the world.  \\nIn urban areas within the European Union, infrastructure bottle-\\nnecks and selective reallocation of road space are likely to result \\nin increased traffic congestion and reduced accessibility. Simul-\\ntaneously, there is an increasing trend towards policies that dis-\\ncourage car use in city centres. The planned deployment of smart \\ncity technologies would, however, primarily affect cities in China. \\nCORNERSTONES OF THE STRATEGY \\nThe BMW Group’s strategy is oriented to its corporate purpose: \\n“The BMW  Group exists to move body, heart and mind.”  \\nIt is the driving force, the guiding principle and the orientation for \\nour employees, and our commitment to our active role in society. \\nIts long-term focus guides us purposefully through the extensive \\ntransformation of the entire automotive industry and beyond. \\nTransitioning to the specific details of the BMW Group strategy, \\nthe BMW Group Impact broadens the Company’s long-term stra-\\ntegic vision and underscores its ambition to contribute to broader \\nsocietal development. “We make individual mobility more hu-\\nman, intelligent and responsible – creating an inspiring future for \\nall of us.” \\nWith this in mind, the BMW Group’s corporate strategy \\n(BMW Group strategy) defines the strategic framework and lays \\nthe foundation for the Company to maintain a consistent and \\nmarket-oriented focus on profitability, growth and sustainability, \\neven in an increasingly dynamic environment.

It aims to find the right balance be-\\ntween business, the environment and society. The  key areas of \\nfocus within the strategy are electrification, digitalisation and \\nsustainability or circularity. This enables us to seamlessly merge \\nenjoyment and responsibility, without compromising, and to \\nachieve our growth and profitability objectives.  \\nThe BMW Group is committed to the Paris Climate Agreement. \\nTo achieve this, the BMW Group promotes the reduction of car-\\nbon emissions throughout the whole life cycle of its products as \\nwell as the principles of the circular economy with a verifiable \\ntrack record of continuous improvement – from the supply chain \\nto production, the use phase and the recycling of its products. For \\nthis reason, the BMW  Group has laid out measurable, science -\\nbased targets to be reached by 2030; these are firmly estab-\\nlished across the company (base year 2019). Carbon emissions \\nare to be reduced as follows: \\n1. An average of 80% carbon reduction at our own plants \\nand locations (Scope 1 and 2) per vehicle produced \\n(↗ Carbon emissions generated at BMW Group locations) \\n2. Carbon reduction during the vehicle’s use phase (Scope 3 \\ndownstream) by an average of at least 50% per kilometre \\ndriven. Increased efficiency in our electrified models and \\nthe new generation of combustion engine technology will \\nmake this possible. An additional driving force for this is the \\ndynamic growth in demand for our electrified vehicles \\n↗ Electromobility, ↗ Automotive segment \\n3. An average of at least 20%* carbon reduction in the supply \\nchain (Scope 3 upstream) per vehicle produced ↗ Carbon \\nemissions in the supply chain \\nWe have joined the Science -Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for \\nthis purpose. This will enable us to guarantee transparency and \\ncomparability in the validation and measurement of our targets \\nand, at the same time, ensure they are in line with the latest sci-\\nentific findings and regulatory requirements.

The BMW Group is shap-\\ning the future of sustainable mobility with its passion and strong \\ncapacity for innovation. Thanks to its exciting products, the BMW \\nGroup is able to achieve maximum customer satisfaction and \\nbrand strength, and thus grow its market share. \\nEconomic performance is a very important aspect of our corpo-\\nrate management system and is anchored in our objective of har-\\nnessing growth potential and securing our profitability targets. \\nThis is supported by our ambitious financial standards, which are \\nlinked to the strategic key figures EBIT margin in the Automotive \\nsegment (between 8 and 10%), RoCE in the Automotive seg-\\nment of at least 18% and an EBT margin in the Group of more \\nthan 10%. ↗ Performance Indicators and Performance Management \\nThe quality and reliability of all of our products and services are \\nthe critical drivers for customer satisfaction, enthusiasm and the \\neconomic success of the BMW Group. We are therefore commit-\\nted to a comprehensive approach to quality, centred on deliver-\\ning the best possible customer experience. The “Mission Quality” \\ninitiative was launched across the Company in 2023. As a key \\narea of focus for the Company, the initiative promotes the \\nstrengthening of quality awareness and focuses on the individual \\ncontributions of all employees.  \\nDigitalisation is consistently extended beyond the vehicle \\n↗ Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation, encompassing both \\ncorporate and customer processes, as well as along the automo-\\ntive value chain, enhancing the resilience and business agility of \\nthe BMW Group. There are corresponding initiatives in all  \\nareas of the Company. Our “Digital Process & Impact” initiative \\nis an example of commitment to significantly accelerating the \\ndigitalisation of our internal processes and operations across the \\nCompany, harnessing digital potential in every area through the \\nuse of digitalised process management. The dedicated process \\nand digitalisation functions ensure the consistent implementa-\\ntion and corresponding development of expertise across all de-\\npartments. Concurrently, March 2023 marked the launch of DIG-\\nITAL BOOST, one of the most comprehensive training pro-\\ngramme in the BMW Group’s history. This virtual training pro-\\ngramme, designed for employees in indirect roles across all lev-\\nels of the organisation, delivers insights and opportunities in dig-\\nitalisation on both national and international fronts. The aim is \\nfor all employees to acquire the same basic knowledge of digital-\\nisation, enabling them to identify potential within their own areas \\nof responsibility and harness it for the benefit of the BMW Group. \\n \\nStrategic approach – \\nWhere is the BMW Group heading? \\nThe BMW Group is focused on its customers worldwide and on \\nmeeting their different requirements. It does so by understanding \\nthe needs of its current and future customers and exceeding their \\nexpectations. It combines ground-breaking technologies, emo-\\ntional products and individual customer care to create a unique \\noverall experience. The fields of action electrification, digitalisa-\\ntion and circularity are of particular importance. \\nWe recognised the importance of electromobility early on and \\nhave been working resolutely to accelerate the adoption of all -\\nelectric and connected mobility. By the close of 2023, the  \\nBMW Group had introduced at least one all-electric model across \\nall its brands and segments. In 2023, the extended -wheelbase \\nversion of the iX1 for the Chinese market, the BMW i5* sedan and \\nthe Rolls-Royce Spectre* were launched on the market. In 2023, \\ndeliveries of all- electric automobiles increased by more than \\n74.1%, reaching 375,716 automobiles, up from 215,752 auto-\\nmobiles in 2022. ↗ Electromobility \\nIn 2024, the market will welcome several new additions, includ-\\ning the BMW iX2*, the extended-wheelbase version of the BMW \\ni5 sedan tailored for the Chinese market, the BMW i5 Touring*, \\nthe MINI Cooper SE*, the MINI Countryman SE* and the all-elec-\\ntric MINI Aceman, the brand’s first crossover model. ↗ Automotive \\nsegment The BMW Group expects its attractive product range to \\ndrive another significant increase in the number of all-electric ve-\\nhicles delivered in 2024. With intelligent vehicle architectures \\nand flexible production facilities, the company is well- prepared \\nfor the continued expansion of electromobility. Society’s ac-\\nceptance of electromobility will depend on trends in customer de-\\nmand, regional regulations and the development of a suitable \\nframework, with a particular focus on infrastructure expansion. \\nThe BMW Group is currently planning for all- electric vehicles to \\naccount for more than 50% of all vehicles by 2030. The Rolls -\\nRoyce brand is set to become all-electric by 2030, and the MINI \\nbrand will follow suit by the early 2030s. ↗ Electromobility \\nThe launch of the BMW CE 04 electric scooter has successfully \\nestablished BMW Motorrad’s position in the electromobility land-\\nscape.

In an increasingly digital envi-\\nronment with changing customer needs, the Company relies on \\na future-oriented sales structure with a focus on the digitalisation \\nof the customer interface and direct customer access. The aim is \\nto offer the industry’s best premium customer experience. In this \\ncontext, the My BMW App and MINI  App play a significant role \\nwith over 12 million users (as at December 2023). More than \\nthree million customers (as at December 2023) access the apps \\nevery day. Using their smartphones, they interact with their BMW \\nor MINI vehicles, the BMW Group itself and the BMW and MINI \\ndealerships, and also receive personalised offers. The relation-\\nship with the customer thus becomes even closer. \\nThe BMW  Group is decisively and consistently driving forward \\nwith its online sale of vehicles. Customers are free to choose \\nwhether they would like to order their vehicle from agents or \\nonline. They also have the option to seamlessly transition be-\\ntween both worlds.  \\nA central aspect of the revamped sales structure is the transition \\nto direct sales. After the pilot market in South Africa, MINI was \\nthe first Group brand to implement the new sales model in China \\nin March 2023, followed by Europe in January 2024 with Italy, \\nPoland and Sweden. The remaining European countries will \\ntransition over the course of 2024 and 2025 and the BMW brand \\nwill follow suit in Europe in 2026. Going forward, our existing \\ntrading partners will continue in their roles as active commercial \\nintermediaries between the BMW Group and our  \\ncustomers. \\nThe trading partners will be closely involved in the implementa-\\ntion. The new sales structure offers an attractive and sustainable \\nbusiness model for these partners, and they will continue to be \\nthe face for customers in the future, where they can focus on \\nproviding the best advice and support. At the same time, we aim \\nto achieve consistent prices across each sales channel.  \\nBy enabling smooth transitions between physical and digital \\nchannels and launching direct sales, the BMW Group is improv-\\ning direct customer connections – an essential step for providing \\nthe best customer experience ↗ Automotive segment. In the Finan-\\ncial Services segment, we are also continually expanding our ser-\\nvices to include digital and modular services. The aim is for our \\nproducts to be accessible to all customer groups across all chan-\\nnels within our strategic orientation in the Financial Services seg-\\nment. ↗ Financial Services segment. This ensures that our customers \\nreceive personalised offers designed to meet their specific \\nneeds. \\nCircularity is a key focus for the BMW Group in the drive towards \\nmore resource-efficient mobility. The concept revolves around \\nrecycling materials to the fullest extent, ensuring that  resources \\nare utilised sustainably and retain their value over time. This ap-\\nproach opens up a range of opportunities across the entire value \\nchain. Reusing valuable resources reduces our reliance on pri-\\nmary raw materials and their fluctuating prices. Furthermore, the \\nuse of high-quality secondary materials significantly reduces the \\ncarbon footprint of our vehicles. ↗ Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency \\nand Renewable Energy. We aim to progress gradually towards a cir-\\ncular economy, from designing for circularity through to increas-\\ning the use of secondary materials for parts and components and \\nultimately advancing to the recycling of end-of-life vehicles. \\n \\nCollaboration – \\nHow does the BMW Group achieve this?   \\nThe BMW Group constantly strives for the best results, support-\\ning its employees with the discovery and development of their \\npotential so they are able to remain productive. We support and \\nchallenge strong teams with complementary strengths who work \\ntogether to achieve the best solutions in a complex environment. \\nWe see diversity as an important element of our competitiveness. \\n↗ Employees and Society  The diversity metric defines the share of \\nwomen in management positions as a key performance indicator \\nand a strategic target variable. The aim is to increase the share \\nof women in management positions at the BMW  Group to 22% \\nby 2025. ↗ Performance Indicators and Performance Management \\nBMW Group employees not only work closely together within the \\nCompany, but also with external partners. The stable relation-\\nships that have grown in our partner networks over time are \\nbased on the same values as those at the BMW Group. They al-\\nlow us to maximise our effectiveness and work together to lead \\nthe Company to success. Experiences from the crisis years have \\nfurther strengthened these relationships, as exemplified by our \\nsupply chains. ↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network \\nTogether with our cooperation partners, we realise potential by \\naccessing more expertise and improving our profitability and \\ntechnology footprint. In addition to the collaboration with Qual-\\ncomm in the advancement of assisted and automated driving, \\nthe development partnership between the BMW Group and Solid \\nPower, for instance, presents advantages for both compani es. \\nExamples include our Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre \\n(CMCC) in Parsdorf near Munich, where our expertise in design-\\ning and manufacturing solid-state cells is continuously expanded \\nthrough a dedicated prototype line, bringing significant value to \\nour partnership with Solid Power. We continuously expand our \\ncollaborations to unlock additional potential for value creation in \\nthe Group. ↗ Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation \\nThe BMW Group invests in the development of employee skills, \\nwith the view that continuous training guarantees jobs world-\\nwide. ↗ Employees and Society The restructuring of our Munich head-\\nquarters is an example of this commitment. The complete re-\\nstructuring of an entire plant, including combustion engine vehi-\\ncle production, to 100% electromobility, will be implemented by \\n2027 while production is ongoing. The BMW Group is already \\ndesigning and producing electrified drive components for its ex-\\nisting electric vehicles at German facilities in Munich, Dingolfing, \\nLeipzig and Regensburg, as well as in China at the Shenyang lo-\\ncation. For the next generation of high-voltage batteries, new as-\\nsembly sites will be established in Debrecen (Hungary), San Luis \\nPotosí (Mexico), Woodruff near Spartanburg (USA) and in Ger-\\nmany at the planned new facility in Irlbach-Straßkirchen, accom-\\npanied by the development of corresponding expertise.

Capital is \\nconsidered to be employed profitably when the amount of profit \\ngenerated on a sustained basis exceeds the cost of equity and \\ndebt capital. This strategy also secures the desired degree of cor-\\nporate autonomy in the long term. \\n \\nThe BMW\\u202fGroup’s performance management system is based \\non a multilayered structure. Operational performance is man-\\naged primarily at segment level. In order to influence long -term \\ncorporate performance, additional performance indicators are \\ntaken into account within the management system at Group \\nlevel. In this context, the value added serves as one of several \\nindicators to measure the contribution made to enterprise value \\nduring the financial year. \\nThis aspiration to add value is measured at both Group and seg-\\nment level by means of the key performance indicators. The link \\nbetween value added and the relevant value drivers is presented \\nin a simplified form below. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBMW Group – Value drivers  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nManaging sustainability \\nThe BMW\\u202fGroup’s long-term corporate strategy is determined \\nby the Board of Management. Responsibility for imp lementing \\nthe Group’s sustainability goals also lies with the full Board. Sig-\\nnificant decisions are therefore evaluated from the point of view \\nof sustainability. This ensures that sustainability issues are sys-\\ntematically integrated in decision-making proce sses and to \\ncompensation at top management levels. As part of the proce-\\ndures for managing sustainability on an integrated basis at cor-\\nporate level, a Group target system has been created, which ap-\\nplies to specific departments. \\nThe BMW\\u202fGroup has set itself the target of decarbonising its \\nvehicle fleet by at least 40% over the entire life cycle by 2030, \\nbased on the reference year 2019. In this context, specific tar-\\ngets have been set for the scopes of the vehicle’s use phase, \\nproduction and supply chain (↗ Position, ↗ Carbon Emissions). This \\nentails setting specific carbon targets for each vehicle project, \\nmanaging them through digital processes and tracking their at-\\ntainment. \\nAn integrated approach to target management ensures that the \\nBMW Group’s vehicle projects make a positive contribution to-\\nwards achieving the sustainability targets that have been set. \\nFurthermore, the BMW Group will consistently increase its use \\nof secondary raw materials. The Group intends to already have \\nmade significant progress by 2025 with the introduction of the \\nfirst X model of the NEUE KLASSE. Non-financial performance \\nindicators such as carbon emissions and, in future, secondary \\nraw materials quotas are therefore key performance indicators \\nfor all new vehicle projects.

Depending on \\nthe business model, the segments are measured on the basis of \\nreturn on total capital or return on equity. \\nReturn on capital employe d (RoCE) is used for the Automotive \\nand Motorcycles segments and return on equity (RoE) for the Fi-\\nnancial Services segment. These indicators combine a wide \\nrange of relevant economic information, such as profitability (re-\\nturn on sales) and capital efficiency (capital turnover) to measure \\nsegment performance and the development of enterprise value. \\nAutomotive segment \\nThe most comprehensive key performance indicator used for the \\nAutomotive segment is RoCE, which provides information on the \\nprofitability of capital employed and business operations. Value \\ndriver analyses are used to interpret the causes of a change in \\nRoCE and derive suitable measures to influence its development. \\nThe capital employed items taken into account reflect the focus \\nof operational segment management. Capital employed is \\ncalculated as the sum of intangible assets, property, plant and \\nequipment and net working capital, the latter comprising inven-\\ntories and trade receivables less trade payables. The amount of \\ncapital employed increased in light of the full consolidation of \\nBMW Brilliance in the BMW Group Financial Statements as at \\n11 February 2022. The increase arose primarily due to the take-\\nover of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as \\nwell as the capitalisation of reacquired rights in conjunction with \\nthe purchase price allocation. The RoCE will be impacted tempo-\\nrarily by the higher capital base as well as the related amortisa-\\ntion expense expected to be recorded. \\nThe strategic target for RoCE is 18%. \\nDue to the special s ignificance of RoCE for the BMW \\u202fGroup, the \\nAutomotive segment is also managed on the basis of  a number \\nof additional key performance indicators that have a significant \\nimpact on RoCE and hence on segment performance.

Group profit/loss before tax pro-\\nvides a comprehensive measure of the Group’s overall corporate \\nperformance after consolidation effects and enables a transpar-\\nent comparison over time. Other key performance indicators at \\nGroup level are the size of the workforce at the year-end as well \\nas the share of women in management positions. By 2025, the \\nBMW Group aims to increase the share of women in manage-\\nment positions to 22%. ↗ Strategy Process \\nThe information provided by these key performance indicators at \\nGroup level is complemented by the two financial performance \\nindicators of pre-tax return on sales and val ue added. Value \\nadded, as a highly aggregated performance indicator, also pro-\\nvides an insight into capital efficiency and the (opportunity) cost \\nof capital required to generate Group profit. A positive value \\nadded means that a return on investment above the cost of cap-\\nital has been achieved. \\nCapital employed comprises the amount of Group equity and \\npension provisions as well as the financial liabilities of the Auto-\\nmotive and Motorcycles segments employed on average at the \\nend of each of the last five quarters. \\nThe earnings amount corresponds to Group profit/loss before \\ntax, adjusted for interest expense incurred in conjunction with the \\npension provisions and on the financial liabilities of the Automo-\\ntive and Motorcycles segments (profit/loss before interest ex-\\npense and tax). The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return \\nexpected by capital providers in return for the capital employed. \\nSince capital employed comprises an equity capital (e.g. share \\ncapital) and a debt capital element (e.g. bonds), the overall cost \\nof capital is determined on the basis of the weighted average \\nrates for equity and debt capital, measured using standard mar-\\nket procedures. The pre-tax average weighted cost of capital for \\nthe BMW Group in 2023 was 12%, unchanged from the previ-\\nous year. \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn order to determine the internal rate of return, risk-adjusted cost \\nof capital rates are based on the average of actual rates in recent \\nyears. In light of the long-term nature of product and investment \\ndecisions, the following internal rates of return ar e used in con-\\njunction with segment management: \\nin %  2023  2022 \\nAutomotive  12.0  12.0 \\nMotorcycles  12.0  12.0 \\nFinancial Services  13.4  13.4 \\n    \\nValue-based management for project decisions \\nOperational business in the Automotive and Motorcycles seg-\\nments is largely shaped by the life-cycle-dependent character of \\ninvestment projects that have a substantial influence on future \\nperformance. Project-related decisions are therefore a crucial el-\\nement of financial management in the BMW Group. Project deci-\\nsions are based on calculations derived from the expected cash \\nflows of each individual project. Calculations are made for the \\ncomplete term of a project, incorporating future years in which \\nthe project is expected to generate cash flows. \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\nProject decisions are taken on the basis of net present value and \\nthe internal rate of return calculated for the project. The net pre-\\nsent value indicates the extent to which the project will be able to \\ngenerate future net cash inflows over and above the cost of cap-\\nital. A project with a positive net present value enhances future \\nvalue added and therefore results in an increase in enterprise \\nvalue. The project’s internal rate of return measures the average \\nreturn on the capital employed in the project. For all project deci-\\nsions, the project criteria and long -term impact on periodic re-\\nsults are measured and incorporated in the long -term Group \\nplan. This approach enables an analysis of the impact of project \\ndecisions on periodic earnings and rates of return for each year \\nduring the term of the project. \\nBoard of Management remuneration \\nPerformance criteria for the variable remuneration paid to mem-\\nbers of the Board of Management are based on the key strategic \\ntargets and performanc e indicators.

While the US and China recorded \\nstronger growth than in the previous year, economic growth in \\nEurope weakened. \\nIn the eurozone, growth in 2023 was 0.5% due to high inflation \\nrates and the resulting fall in demand. In Germany, GDP con-\\ntracted by 0.3% as a result of rising prices, declining export de-\\nmand and the low level of investments in light of higher interest \\nrates. In France (+0.9%), Italy (+0.7%) and Spain (+2.5%), eco-\\nnomic growth was more robust. The UK experienced a significant \\nslowdown in growth to 0.1%.  \\nIn the USA, the economy proved very resilient in the face of rising \\ninterest rates and grew by 2.5% in the reporting period. A sus-\\ntained low level of unemployment in combination with rising \\nwages helped boost consumption. In China, the growth rate in \\n2023 stood at 5.2%, slightly higher than the target set by the \\ngovernment. The momentum resulted in particular from catch-\\nup effects following the end of coronavirus lockdowns. \\nThe Japanese economy recovered well during the reporting pe-\\nriod with a growth rate of 1.8%, benefiting from stronger export \\ndemand on the back of the depreciated currency. \\nHigher benchmark interest rates in many markets and a \\nstrong euro \\nAt the beginning of 2023, inflation remained relatively high in a \\nnumber of countries.

(BMW Bril-\\nliance) has been  fully consolidated as a subsidiary since 11 Feb-\\nruary 2022, whereas up to that date, it had been accounted for \\nusing the equity method. Consequently, BMW  Brilliance is in-\\ncluded for the whole of 2023, but only for a proportionate period \\nof the previous year. \\nGroup revenues totalled € 155,498 million in the reporting year \\n(2022: € 142,610 million), representing a solid increase over \\nthe previous year (+9.0%). The main reason for revenue growth \\nwas the higher number of vehicles delivered. Furthermore, fa-\\nvourable product mix effects and the aforementioned full consol-\\nidation of BMW Brilliance contributed to t he year -on-year in-\\ncrease in revenues. Additionally, higher interest rates and in-\\ncome from dealership financing further increased revenues in \\n2023, mainly reflecting the impact of higher inventory levels held \\nby dealerships in light of improved vehicle availability, model \\nchanges and a higher average financing volume per vehicle. \\nReduced intersegment eliminations associated with leasing \\nbusiness had a positive impact on revenues. \\n \\n    \\nThese favourable factors were offset by unfavourable exchange \\nrate effects from the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar which \\nheld down Group revenues. \\nThe year-on-year increase in cost of sales reflected sales volume \\ngrowth as well as higher expenses for materials and warranty \\nobligations. Similarly, cost of sales recorded by BMW Brilliance \\nalso contributed to an increase compared to 2022. Cost of sales \\nin the previous financial year were also additionally negatively \\nimpacted by the first-time full consolidation of BMW  Brilliance. \\nRising interest rates incre ased interest expenses for the Finan-\\ncial Services segment. \\nGroup research and development expenses increased signifi-\\ncantly by 13.8% year on year. Research and development ex-\\npenditure related primarily to the digitalisation and electrification \\nof the vehicle fleet across all model series, as well as the devel-\\nopment of automated driving functions. Further expenditure was \\nincurred for the development of new models, such as the all-elec-\\ntric BMW i5 *, the X3 and X5 and the Rolls -Royce Spectre and \\nNEUE KLASSE models. \\nDue to revenue growth, the research and development expendi-\\nture ratio remained at the same level as one year earlier. \\nSelling and administrative expenses went up slightly by 3.9% \\nyear on year. The rise was due to higher administrative ex-\\npenses, primarily influenced by higher costs for IT projects, nota-\\nbly in connection with the planned switch to direct sales in Eu-\\nrope.

The year -\\non-year increase in credit financing for dealerships was driven by \\nimproved vehicle availability, model changes and a higher aver-\\nage financing volume per vehicle. \\nA furt her factor for the decrease in cash inflow from operating \\nactivities was the higher level of inventories held with a view to \\nservicing markets and fulfilling customer demand. A lower in-\\ncrease in receivables and higher payables had a positive impact \\non the cash inflow from operating activities.  \\nThe cash outflow from investing activities was higher than one \\nyear earlier. In 2022, the first-time full consolidation of BMW Bril-\\nliance resulted in a positive impact of € 3,587 million to cash out-\\nflow from investing activities, resulting from cash acquired on the \\nbusiness combination and the purchase price paid. Moreover, in-\\ncreased investments in property, plant and equipment, particu-\\nlarly for introducing new vehicle models, digitalising the fleet as \\nwell as pressing ahead with automated driving and the NEUE \\nKLASSE, resulted in a higher net cash outflow than one year ear-\\nlier.  \\nIn contrast, the net cash inflow arising on the sale of marketable \\nsecurities had a positive impact on cash flows from investing \\nactivities. \\nThe decrease in the net cash outflow from financing activities \\nwas mainly the result of higher borrowings and lower repay-\\nments.  \\nHigher dividend payments to shareholders of BMW AG (2023: \\n€ 5,430 million; 2022: € 3,827 million) increased the net cash \\noutflow from financing activities. \\n \\nFree cash flow for the Au tomotive segment was as follows: \\n \\nin € million 2023 2022 Change \\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from operating activities 17,542 23,523 – 5,981\\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from investing activities – 9,548 –  4,772 –  4,776\\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from financing activities – 6,859 –  17,984 1 1,125 \\nEffects of exchange rate and changes in composition of segment  – 678 9 4 – 772\\nChange in cash and cash equivalents  457 861 – 404\\nin € million 2023 2022 Change \\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from operating activities 17,675 14,782 2,893 \\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from investing activities – 9,373 –  3,179 –  6,194\\nAdjustment for net investment in marketable securities and investment funds  – 1,360 –  532 –  828\\nFree cash flow Automotive segment  6,942 11,071 – 4,129\\nBMW Group cash flows \\nFree cash flow Automotive segment '),\n",

The use of longer -term in-\\nstruments to refinance the Group’s Financial Services business \\nand the maintenance of a sufficiently high liquidity reserve serves \\nto rule out any imminent liquidity risk for the portfolio.

In addition to bonds, the BMW Group also issued commer-\\ncial paper. \\nFurthermore, retail customer and dealership financing receiv -\\nables, rights and obligations from leasing contracts, as well as \\ncollateral interests in the financed vehicles, were transferred to \\nstructured entities that securitise them and place them as collat-\\neralised securities on the capital market as part of the Group’s \\nasset-backed securities financing arrangements (ABS financ-\\ning). \\nSpecific banking instruments, such as the customer deposits \\nused by the Group’s own banks in Germany and the USA, were \\nalso deployed for financing purposes. In addition, loans were \\ntaken from international banks. \\nDuring the reporting period, the BMW Group issued bonds total-\\nling approximately € 9.2 billion.

Customers worldwide responded pos-\\nitively to the appealing and contemporary product portfolios of \\nthe BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands. The BMW Group offers \\na diverse range of drive systems, encompassing all-electric mod-\\nels (BEV), state-of-the-art plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and highly ef-\\nficient combustion engines, to meet a wide range of customer re-\\nquirements. The ramp-up of electric mobility was also a signifi-\\ncant driver of growth in 2023.  \\nIn total, during the reporting year, the BMW Group delivered \\n2,554,183 automobiles across the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce \\nbrands, setting a new record high. In line with expectations, a \\nsolid year-on-year increase in deliveries1 was therefore achieved \\nin the reporting year (2022: 2,399,6322 units; +6.4%). \\nThe BMW brand set a new record with deliveries totalling \\n2,252,793 units (2022: 2,100,6892 units; +7.2%). MINI deliv-\\nered 295,358 units, similar to one year earlier (2022: 292,922 \\nunits; +0.8%). Rolls-Royce, the renowned luxury marque, deliv-\\nered 6,032 units to customers, achieving a new all- time high \\n(2022: 6,021 units; +0.2%). \\nElectric mobility maintains momentum \\nThe BMW Group’s sales growth in the reporting year was signif-\\nicantly influenced by the systematic electrification of its product \\nrange. This was borne out by continued strong growth in deliver-\\nies of all-electric vehicles. Market demand for all-electric vehicles \\nfrom the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands resulted in deliver-\\nies rising to 375,716 units (2022: 215,752 3 units; +74.1%). \\nOverall, the BMW Group delivered more than half a million elec-\\ntrified vehicles (BEV and PHEV) to customers for the first time \\nwith a total of 565,875 units (2022: 433,7923 units; +30.4%). \\nThe share of all-electric vehicles in deliveries increased to 14.7% \\nin 2023 (2022: 9.0%; +63.3%). The significant increase also \\nhad a positive effect on the development of fleet carbon emis-\\nsions. ↗ Carbon Emissions \\nThe success of the BMW i44 and BMW iX14 models had a major \\nimpact on sales growth. The BMW iX3 4 and the BMW iX 4 also \\ncontinued to enjoy great popularity. Furthermore, electrification \\nmade its debut in its top  model series in the form of the BMW i74 \\nLuxury Sedan. The new BMW  i54 Business Sedan was also \\nadded to the range of all -electric automobiles.

The new BMW X5 and BMW X6 \\nflagship models were launched in the spring. The new BMW 5 \\nSeries Sedan followed in autumn. At market launch, all drivetrain \\nvariants were available for this model, including the first all-elec-\\ntric BMW i51, the two PHEV models BMW 530e1 and BMW 550e \\nxDrive1, as well as models powered by conventional combustion \\nengines. The globally popular Business Sedan, which received \\nan overwhelmingly positive response from the international trade \\npress shortly after its launch, will be available on the Chinese \\nmarket from early 2024. In October 2023, the BMW X2 also cel-\\nebrated its world premiere with its first all-electric BMW iX2 1 \\nmodel. The market launch will start in spring 2024. \\nBMW M sets new record \\nBMW M is also on course for growth. With a significant increase \\nof 14.2% to a total of 202,431 units, sales of high-performance \\nautomobiles surpassed the 200,000-mark for the first time \\n(2022: 177,258 units). The positive development is also a result \\nof the electrification of the BMW M model range: the highest-vol-\\nume model was once again the Sports Coupé BMW i4 M501.  \\nThe focus on the electrification of drive systems was also evident \\nin market launches in 2023. Right at the beginning of the year, \\nthe BMW XM1 was launched worldwide as BMW M’s first high -\\nperformance class PHEV. The BMW i7 M70 xDrive1 and BMW i5 \\nM60 xDrive1 models expanded the BMW M portfolio of all -elec-\\ntric high-performance vehicles. \\nThe 2024 model year looks highly promising. Following the suc-\\ncess of the BMW M3 CS1, another special model in the high-per-\\nformance class, the BMW M4 CS, is on the verge of being \\nlaunched. Further updates to the BMW M3, BMW M4 and BMW \\nM2 have already been announced and will be introduced during \\nthe year.

In 2023, it has been included for the full year. \\nAt € 132,277 million (2022: € 123,602 million; + 7.0%, cur-\\nrency-adjusted: +11.3%), the Automotive segment recorded a \\nsolid year-on-year increase in revenues on the back of higher ve-\\nhicle sales. In the previous year, vehicle sales fell due to produc-\\ntion cutbacks caused by the limited availability of semiconductors \\nand wiring harnesses as well as pandemic-related lockdowns in \\nChina. Furthermore, the increased volume of high-revenue mod-\\nels sold, such as the BMW 7 Series and the BMW X5, as well as \\ngrowth in spare parts and accessories business, also contributed \\nto the year-on-year increase in revenues. The full consolidation \\nof BMW Brilliance also increased revenues. Unfavourable cur-\\nrency translation effects, primarily from the Chinese renminbi and \\nthe US dollar, held down the increase in revenues. \\nThe segment’s cost of sales amounted to € 109,920 million and \\nwas therefore moderately higher than the previous year (2022: \\n€ 104,324 million; + 5.4%). Similar to revenue, higher vehicle \\nsales and full consolidation of BMW Brilliance also had an impact \\nin this regard. The segment’s cost of sales was also negatively \\nimpacted by increased expenses for warranties. A higher propor-\\ntion of electrified, especially all-electric, vehicles also contributed \\nto increased costs. \\nIn the previous year, the impact of the full consolidation o f \\nBMW Brilliance, including approximately € 1.8 billion in depreci-\\nation from purchase price allocation and the elimination of ap-\\nproximately € 1.3 billion in intra-group profits, had a negative ef-\\nfect on the cost of sales. Depreciation from the purchase price \\nallocation amounted to approximately € 1.4 billion in 2023.  \\nThe increased research and development expenditure  is primar-\\nily related to the cross-series digitalisation and electrification of \\nthe vehicle fleet, as well as the development of automated driving \\nfunctions. Furthermore, the expenditure resulted from the \\ndevelopment of new models, such as the BMW  5 Series and \\nNEUE KLASSE models, for example. \\nSelling and administrative expenses rose to € 9,195 million in \\nthe reporting period ( 2022: € 8,801 million; + 4.5%). A signifi-\\ncant reason for the increase is higher costs for IT projects.  \\nThe net amount  of other operating income and expenses de-\\ncreased year-on-year. Among other factors, other operating in-\\ncome in the previous year included higher reversals of provisions. \\nAt € 12,981 million, profit before financial result in the 2023 fi-\\nnancial year was significantly higher than in the same period of \\nthe previous year (2022: € 10,635 million; + 22.1%). The full \\nconsolidation of BMW  Brilliance had a dampening impact in \\n2022 in the year-on-year comparison. \\nThe EBIT margin for the segment was at 9.8% for the reporting \\nyear (2022: 8.6%; +1.2 percentage points). As forecasted in the \\nquarterly report for 30 September 2023, the EBIT margin was \\nwithin the range of 9.0 to 10.5%. \\nThe financial result of the Automotive segment was a net nega-\\ntive amount of € 339 million and therefore significantly down on \\nthe previous year’s corresponding figure (2022: net positive  \\n \\namount of € 8,283 million). The main reason for the year -on-\\nyear deterioration was the gain of €  7.7 billion recognised in \\n2022 in other financial result arising on the remeasurement of \\nthe segment’s previous at-equity interest in BMW Brilliance.  \\nIn the year under report, the interest result was primarily im-\\npacted by higher expenses arising from the unwinding of interest \\non discounted provisions, while interest income from bank de-\\nposits had an offsetting effect. In the previous year, interest in-\\ncome arising from the change in interest rates in connection with \\nthe unwinding of interest on discounted provisions was reported \\nwithin interest and similar expenses.  \\nAt € 12,642 million, profit before tax for the financial year 2023 \\nwas significantly down on the previous year (2022: \\n€ 18,918 million), whereby the decrease was primarily due to \\nthe gain of € 7.7 billion recognised in other financial result in \\n2022 arising on the remeasurement of the segment’s previous \\nat-equity interest in BMW Brilliance. \\nThe Automotive segment’s return on capital emp loyed (RoCE) \\nfor 2023 finished at 20.2%, and was therefore within the pre-\\ndicted target range of 18 to 22% (2022: 18.1%; +2.1 percent-\\nage points).

In a year-on-\\nyear comparison, net interest expense of € 1 million in 2023 had \\na negative impact on the financial result (2022: net interest in-\\ncome of € 12 million). In the previous year, interest income aris-\\ning from the change in interest rates in connection with the un-\\nwinding of interest on discounted provisions was reported within \\ninterest and similar expenses. In contrast, decreasing interest \\nrates had a negative impact in 2023. \\nThe return on capital employed (RoCE) in the Motorcycles seg-\\nment for the reporting year came in at 22.1%, and was therefore \\nwithin the expected target range of 21 to 26% (2022: 24.9%; -\\n2.8 percentage points). The primary factor for the year -on-year \\nchange was the rise in net working capital, driven by a number of \\nfactors, including the model update in 2023 and a moderate in-\\ncrease in inventory levels. \\nFINANCIAL SERV IC ES SEGMENT  \\nFinancial Services segment earnings down on previous year \\nProfit before tax reported by the Financial Services segment for \\nthe financial year 2023 amounted to € 2,962 million ( 2022: \\n€ 3,205 million; -7.6%) and was therefore moderately down on \\nthe previous year. Key reasons for the decrease were higher re-\\nfinancing costs due to rising interest rates and a decrease in the \\ncontract portfolio. Remarketing revenues from lease returns re-\\nmained at a high level, but were nevertheless below the previous \\nyear’s figure. This also had a negative impact on earnings com-\\npared to the previous year. On the other hand, a lower expense \\nfor credit risk provisioning had a positive effect on earnings. In \\nthe previous year, the level of expense recognised in connection \\nwith credit risk provisioning was heavily influenced by geopolitical \\nuncertainties and a weaker macroeconomic outlook. \\nThe credit loss ratio for the e ntire credit portfolio remained at a \\nlow level in 2023, finishing at 0.18% for the year (2022: 0.13%). \\nIn balance sheet terms, business volume increased slightly to \\nstand at € 137,910 million (2022: € 135,689 million; +1.6%). \\nStable earnings performance by Financial Services segment \\nReturn on equity for the Financial Services segment remained at \\na similar level to the previous year, finishing at 17.2% for the fi-\\nnancial year 2023 (2022: 17.9%; -0.7 percentage points). Re-\\nturn on equity for 2023 was therefore within the revised target \\nrange of between 16 and 19%.  \\nNew business with retail customers in line with last year’s \\nlevel \\nCredit financing and leasing business with retail customers re-\\nmained at the same level in 2013, with a total of 1,542,514 new \\ncontracts concluded (2022: 1,545,490 contracts; -0.2%). Out of \\nthe new contracts concluded in 2023, 325,320 contracts (2022: \\n321,535 contracts; +1.2%) related to credit financing and leas-\\ning of pre-owned BMW Group vehicles. \\n \\n \\nNew lease business grew by 8.5 % increase in 2023, whereas \\ncredit financing business contracted by 4.1%. Leasing ac-\\ncounted for 33.6% of total new business, credit financing for \\n66.4%. \\nThe total volume new credit financing and leasing contracts with \\nretail customers rose by 3.4% to € 57,333 million (2022: \\n€ 55,449 million), mainly due to a higher average financing vol-\\nume per vehicle as a result of an improved product mix in the \\nAutomotive segment. \\nThe share of new BMW Group vehicles either leased or financed \\nby the Financial Services segment stood at 38.2% * in 2023 \\n(2022: 41.0%; -2.8 percentage points). \\nNew BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the  \\nFinancial Services segment* \\nin % \\n \\n*The calculation only includes automobile markets in which the Financial Services segment is rep-\\nresented by a consolidated entity. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n29.9 28.4 29.7 24.8 22.1\\n22.3 21.4 20.8\\n16.2 16.1\\n52.2 49.8 50.5\\n41.0 38.2\\n0\\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\\nFinancing Leasing'),\n",

The Financial Statements of \\nBMW AG are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the \\nGerman Commercial Code (HGB) and the relevant supplemen-\\ntary requirements contained in the German Stock Corporation \\nAct (AktG).  \\nThe key financial performance indicator for BMW AG is the divi-\\ndend payout ratio. This is defined as the unappropriated profit of \\nBMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to the Group net \\nprofit attributable to shareholders of BMW AG in accordance with \\nIFRS. The key non -financial performance indicators are essen-\\ntially identical and concurrent with those of the BMW Group. \\nThese are described \\nin detail in the ↗ Financial Performance section \\nof the Combined Management Report.  \\nDifferences in accounting treatments based on HGB (used for \\nthe Company Financial Statements) and IFRS (used for the \\nGroup Financial Statements) are mainly to be found in connec-\\ntion with the capitalisation of intangible assets, the creation of \\nvaluation units, the recognition and measurement of financial in-\\nstruments and provisions as well as the recognition of deferred \\ntax assets. Differences also arise in the presentation of assets \\nand liabilities and of items in the income statement. \\nBusiness environment and review of operations \\nThe general and sector -specific environment of BMW  AG is es-\\nsentially the same as that of the BMW Group and is described in \\nthe ↗ Financial Performance section of the Combined Managemen t \\nReport.  \\nBMW AG develops, manufactures  and sells automobiles and \\nmotorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories manufac-\\ntured in-house, by foreign subsidiaries and by external suppliers, \\nand performs services related to these products. Sales activities \\nare carried out primarily through branches, subsidiaries, inde-\\npendent dealerships and importers. Automobile deliveries in-\\ncreased by 235,621 to 2,620,920 units in the financial year \\n2023. This figure includes 692,267 units relating to series sets \\nsupplied to BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, an in-\\ncrease of 50,473 units compared with the previous year.  \\nAs of 31 December 2023, BMW  AG had 85,168 employees, \\nplus 5,733 apprentices, interns and thesis students (31 Decem-\\nber 2022 81,683 employees, plus 5,500 apprentices, interns \\nand thesis students). \\nThe year 2023 was characterised by a volatile business environ-\\nment marked by increasing (geo-)political tensions. In ad dition, \\nin many markets higher inflation rates accompanied by increased \\ninterest rates had a negative impact on the consumer climate. \\nDespite these factors, BMW AG overall looks back on a positive \\nbusiness performance in the reporting year. \\nBMW AG’s solid financial condition is reflected in the results of \\noperations, financial position and net assets reported for the fi-\\nnancial year 2023.

An important instrument in this context is the cash pool \\nbased at BMW AG. \\nCash and cash equivalents decreased slightly by €  62 million to \\n€ 6,145 million due to outflows from investing and financing  \\nactivities. This was offset by the surplus from operating activities.  \\nEquity fell by € 2,286 million to € 17,932 million, mainly due to \\nlower unappropriated profit and lower retained earnings as a re-\\nsult of the share buyback programmes. The equity ratio changed \\nfrom 28.0% to 26.4%. \\nIn order to secure pension obligations, cash funds totalling € 430 \\nmillion were transferred to BMW Trust e. V., Munich, in conjunc-\\ntion with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA), to be invested \\nin plan assets. Plan assets are offset against the related guaran-\\nteed obligations.  \\nAfter offsetting pension plan assets against pension obligations, \\nprovisions for pensions decreased from € 2,871 million to  \\n€ 2,231 million. \\nOther provisions decreased from €  11,686 million to € 11,537 \\nmillion mainly due to a decline in provisions for taxes and provi-\\nsions for liability risks. Conversely, the provision for statutory and \\nnon-statutory warranty and product guarantee obligations in-\\ncreased. \\nThe decrease in liabilities to subsidiaries to € 22,648 million \\n(2022: € 25,703 million) was mainly due to the decline in finan-\\ncial liabilities. \\nDeferred income went up by € 450 million to € 4,501 million and \\nincluded primarily amounts for services still to be performed re-\\nlating to service and maintenance contracts. \\nRisks and opportunities \\nBMW AG's performance is essentially dependent on the same \\nset of risks and opportunities that affect the BMW Group and \\nwhich are described in detail in the ↗ Risks and Opportunities chapter \\nof the Combined Management Report. As a general rule, BMW \\nAG participates in the risks entered into by Group companies in \\nproportion to the respective shareholding percentage. At the \\nsame time, the result on investments has a significant impact on \\nthe earnings of BMW AG. \\nBMW AG is integrated in the Group-wide risk management sys-\\ntem and internal control system of the BMW Gro up. Further in-\\nformation is provided in the ↗ Internal Control System chapter of the \\nCombined Management Report. \\nOutlook \\nFor the financial year 2024, BMW AG expects an unchanged div-\\nidend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accord-\\nance with HGB in relation to the Group net profit attributable to \\nshareholders of BMW AG in accordance with IFRS), and there-\\nfore within the targeted range of between 30 and 40% (2023: \\n33.7%). \\nDue to its significance in the Group and its close ties with Group \\ncompanies, expectations for BMW AG with respect to its non -fi-\\nnancial performance indicators correspond largely to the BMW \\nGroup's outlook. This is described in detail in the ↗ Outlook chapter \\nof the Combined Management Report. \\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtscha ftsprüfungsgesell-\\nschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has issued an unqual-\\nified audit opinion on the Company Financial Statements of BMW \\nAG, of which the balance sheet and the income statement are \\npresented here.

It aims to channel capital flows towards envi-\\nronmentally sustainable economic activities. \\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system that defines eco-\\nnomic activities as environmentally sustainable based on fulfil-\\nment of predetermined technical screening criteria. \\nEssentially, an economic activity can only be classified as sus-\\ntainable if it substantially contributes to one of the following six \\nenvironmental objectives: \\nI. Climate change mitigation \\nII. Climate change adaptation \\nIII. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine re-\\nsources \\nIV. Transition to a circular economy \\nV. Pollution prevention and control \\nVI. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems \\nThis contribution is based on fulfilment of specific predetermined \\nrequirements. Moreover, no other environmental objective may \\nbe significantly harmed during performance of the activity and \\nthe company involved must observe minimum safeguards, \\namong them compliance with human rights. \\nIn the previous year, the BMW Group reported on the Taxonomy-\\neligible and Taxonomy-aligned proportion of its revenues, capital \\nexpenditure and operating expenditure for Environmental Objec-\\ntives I and II.1 From reporting year 2023 on, the BMW Group is \\nalso required to report on the proportion of Taxonomy -eligible \\nrevenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure for \\nEnvironmental Objectives III to VI for the first time, following the \\nnew Delegated Regulation 2023/2486. New activities for Envi-\\nronmental Objectives I and II are set out by Delegated Regulation \\n2023/2485. The BMW Group will be required to report on Tax-\\nonomy alignment for all environmental objectives from reporting \\nyear 2024 onwards. \\nOur holistic understanding of sustainability \\nThe BMW Group supports the overarching goal of the EU Tax-\\nonomy to promote the private financing of environmentally sus-\\ntainable economic activities in order to make Europe the world’s \\nfirst climate-neutral continent by 2050. As a company aspiring \\nto achieve ↗ Net zero across its entire value chain2 by no later than \\n2050, the BMW  Group had already set ambitious, science -\\nbased targets for all three scopes in 2020, which it aims to \\nachieve by 2030 (base year 2019). These goals were validated \\nby the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Each year, the \\nBMW Group informs about the actual level of progress. ↗ The BMW \\nGroup Strategy \\nIn the coming years, as a result of the significant increase in elec-\\ntric mobility, the majority of carbon emissions will no longer be \\ngenerated primarily in the use phase, but in the upstream value \\nchain. Without the planned set of measures to reduce carbon \\nemissions generated within the BMW Group supply chain, these \\nemissions (Scope 3 upstream) would already exceed actual car-\\nbon emissions in the use phase prior to 2030 (Scope 3 down-\\nstream) ↗ The BMW Group Strategy , ↗ Production and Supplier Network , \\n↗ Carbon Emissions. Accordingly, the BMW Group is taking a holistic \\napproach to achieving its sustainability- related targets and is \\ncommitted to considering ↗ Carbon Emissions over the entire life cy-\\ncle. Among other things, the BMW Group’s measures include a \\nfurther reduction in energy demand, increased use of renewable \\nenergy (Scope 1 and 2), the use of new, efficiency-increasing \\ntechnologies (Scope 3 downstream), the use of green electricity \\nas a criterion when awarding contracts to suppliers and a contin-\\nuously increasing secondary raw material quota (Scope 3 up-\\nstream). However, for the economic activities that are relevant to \\nthe BMW Group, the EU Taxonomy focuses exclusively on reduc-\\ning carbon emissions during the use phase that are attributable \\nto low-emissions (until 2025) and emissions-free drivetrains. In-\\ndirect carbon emissions, for instance those produced when gen-\\nerating charging current or during the energy -intensive produc-\\ntion of high -voltage batteries, are not taken into account in the \\ncontext of these economic activities. Moreover, the EU Taxon-\\nomy only reflects the impact of decarbonisation measures on in-\\nhouse production to the extent that  they serve to manufacture \\nTaxonomy-aligned products or to the extent that they are explic-\\nitly included in the description of an activity. For example, in-\\ncreasing the energy efficiency of paint shop processes also re-\\nduces carbon emissions in in-house production when an internal \\ncombustion engine vehicle is painted. The BMW  Group’s sus-\\ntainability efforts in this regard is not or only partially taken into \\naccount as part of currently defined economic activities in the EU \\nTaxonomy. ↗ Carbon Emissions \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1The definition of the three performance indicators and their differentiation from IFRS can be found \\nin the ↗ Glossary. \\n2 In this context the entire value chain is to be understood as Scope 1 and 2 as well as the Scope 3 \\ncategories applicable to the BMW Group (categories 1, 4 and 11) in accordance with the Green-\\nhouse Gas Protocol. \\nEU TAXONOMY  '),\n",

Economic activity \\nCCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 both make a substantial \\ncontribution to Environmental Objective I “Climate change miti-\\ngation” due to the manufacture as well as financing and leasing \\nof low-emission (PHEV < 50 g CO 2/km WLTP by 2025) and \\nzero-emission vehicles (BEV and motorcycles with 0 g CO2/km). \\nEconomic activity CCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 as un-\\ndertaken by the BMW Group are also described under Environ-\\nmental Objective II “Climate change adaptation”. There are, \\nhowever, no identifiable values that can be separated from Envi-\\nronmental Objective I “Climate change mitigation”.1 \\nIn order t o identify the specific carbon emissions of PHEV that \\nare not determined in line with Regulation (EU) 2019/631 \\n(among others, USA and China), assumptions were made based \\non the worst-case value for that vehicle model, even though \\nthese emissions may have been lower in reality. \\nDo no significant harm \\nCompliance with the DNSH criteria was reviewed in the reporting \\nyear for the five additional environmental objectives, based in \\neach case on the specific requirements for economic activity CCM \\n3.3 “Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport” and \\neconomic activity CCM 6.5 “Transport by motorbikes, passenger \\ncars and light commercial vehicles”. \\nThe vehicle portfolio for economic activity CCM 6.5 includes \\nBMW Group vehicles and vehicles from other manufacturers. As \\nno data are available regarding the relevant attributes of these \\nthird-party products, it is currently not possible to make a com-\\nprehensive assessment in relation to the DNSH criteria. For this \\nreason, these vehicles are currently not reported as Taxonomy-\\naligned. \\nClimate change adaptation \\nA robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment is required for \\nboth economic activity CCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 \\nto determine that they do not cause significant harm to Environ-\\nmental Objective II. To satisfy this requirement, the physical cli-\\nmate risks at all key BMW Group production sites are considered \\nand an assessment of any damage that may occur as a result of \\nclimate change is being carried out based on long-term climate \\nprojection scenarios2 up to 2035 and 2050. Moreover, we con-\\nsider potential natural hazards at all of our direct supplier loca-\\ntions in order to adequately take supply risks into account when \\nselecting and evaluating suppliers. Adaptive solutions to mitigate \\nrisks are drawn up and implemented as appropriate based on \\nthe results of this risk analysis and in consultation with site rep-\\nresentatives. For further information, see ↗ Climate-related Risks and \\nOpportunities. \\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective II are ful-\\nfilled for economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5. \\nSustainable use and protection of \\nwater and marine resources and \\nprotection and restoration of \\nbiodiversity and ecosystems \\nIn order to establish that no significant harm is caused to Envi-\\nronmental Objectives III and VI, it is necessary to perform a com-\\nprehensive risk analysis that looks at the preservation and pro-\\ntection of environmental, water and marine resources for eco-\\nnomic activity CCM 3.3 (in both cases, not relevant for economic \\nactivity CCM 6.5). \\nIn this context, the BMW Group carries out environmental impact \\nassessments in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU during \\nthe construction of new and expansion of existing sites within the \\nEU that also take account of water and biodiversity. At locations \\noutside the EU, the BMW Group carries out an environmental im-\\npact assessment based on EU requirements. Moreover, a certi-\\nfied environmental management system pursuant to ISO 14001 \\nhas been implemented at all BMW Group production sites and all \\nlocal statutory requirements are met. ↗ Resource Management at all \\nlocations \\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objectives III and VI \\nare fulfilled for economic activity CCM 3.3. \\nTransition to a circular economy \\nThe requirements for both economic activities of the BMW Group \\nto do no significant harm to Environmental Objective IV differ for \\neach stage of the value chain. We fulfil these requirements during \\nthe manufacturing process for BMW Group vehicles (economic \\nactivity CCM 3.3) by, for example, using secondary raw materials \\nin our products, designing products to facilitate their recycling, \\nmanaging waste at our production sites in a way that prioritises \\nrecycling over disposal, and systematically registering sub-\\nstances of concern along the entire supply chain. With regard to \\nthe use phase and recycling of BMW Group vehicles (economic \\nactivity CCM 6.5), we have set up appropriate processes to com-\\nply with recycling requirements and established measures for \\nmanaging waste during maintenance and at the end of the life \\ncycle.

All substances \\nused by the BMW Group are in compliance with national and Eu-\\nropean laws. Substitutes are sought for hazardous substances \\nthat are categorised as being of very high concern in accordance \\nwith Article 57 and 59 of the REACH Regulation, if they are used \\ndirectly or in a proportion exceeding 0.1% weight by weight in a \\nmixture in the production processes of the BMW Group and are \\nconsequently contained in the products of the BMW Group, while \\ntaking factors such as economic and technical requirements into \\naccount. If the use of these hazardous substances cannot be \\navoided, the BMW Group uses them under controlled conditions \\nin accordance with hazardous material regulations. \\nOn the other hand, it is not possible to meet all criteria to do no \\nsignificant harm to Environmental Objective V in the case of eco-\\nnomic activity CCM 6.5. Current PHEV models with air pollutant \\nemissions under 50 \\u2009g CO2/km WLTP offered by the BMW Group \\nand other manufacturers may make a substantial contribution as \\ndefined by the EU Taxonomy. However, manufacturer specifica-\\ntions for air pollutant emissions in real driving conditions (real \\ndriving emissions, RDE) can only be reduced for selected models \\nto 80% of the limit as required by the EU Taxonomy with refer-\\nence to table 2 in the annex to the Clean Vehicles Directive, due \\nto potentially extreme driving situations. The vast majority of \\nPHEV in the vehicle portfolio for economic activity CCM 6.5 must \\ntherefore be considered not Taxonomy-aligned, even if they \\nmeet these values in everyday driving situations. \\nFor the remaining PHEV and BEV models in  the BMW Group’s \\nvehicle portfolio, further deductions have to be made for individ-\\nual models in the context of economic activity CCM 6.5 in light of \\nthe requirements for rolling resistance coefficients for tyres and \\nin particular the external rolling noise of tyres. Owing to the lim-\\nited availability of data, the eligibility of the models concerned is \\ncalculated in a simplified manner based on the tyres approved \\nfor these models, weighted by their purchase volumes and take \\nrates. \\nThe DNSH requirements for En vironmental Objective V are ful-\\nfilled for economic activity CCM 3.3; however, not all are fulfilled \\nfor economic activity CCM 6.5, owing to the RDE and tyre label \\nrequirements described. \\nMinimum safeguards \\nAdditionally, companies that carry out economic activities as de-\\nfined by the EU Taxonomy are required to establish minimum \\nsafeguards. These require the implementation of processes to \\nensure compliance with due diligence obligations both within an \\norganisation and in stages of the upstream and downstream \\nvalue chain that have been outsourced. Specifically, this refers to \\ncompliance with human rights and topics like bribery, corruption, \\ntaxation and fair competition. In its ↗ Policy statement on respect for \\nhuman rights and corresponding environmental standards, the BMW Group \\nhas, among other things, committed to compliance with the fol-\\nlowing standards for minimum safeguards as defined in Arti-\\ncle 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation: Organization for Economic \\nCooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multin a-\\ntional Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and \\nHuman Rights and the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, \\nwhich we signed back in 2001. ↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network , \\n↗ Compliance and Human Rights \\nThe minimum safeguard requirements are met. \\nEU Taxonomy performance indicators \\nPlease refer to the remarks in the glossary for the definition and \\ncalculation of the Taxonomy-specific performance indicators rev-\\nenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure and their \\ndifferentiation from IFRS. ↗ Glossary \\nThe proportion of total revenues, capital expenditure and oper-\\nating expenditure relating to eligible and non-eligible economic \\nactivities are shown in each case as an aggregate percentage for \\nthe BMW Group. All Taxonomy- eligible revenues,  capital ex-\\npenditure and operating expenditure for economic activities CCM \\n3.3 and CCM 6.5 are disclosed under Environmental Objective I \\n“Climate change mitigation”, given that there are no identifiable \\nvalues for Environmental Objective II “Climate change adapta-\\ntion” that can be separated from Environmental Objective I “Cli-\\nmate change mitigation”. This approach avoids double counting \\nof revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure when \\ndetermining the KPI in the numerator across multiple economic \\nactivities. \\nIn the case of capital expenditure and operating expenditure, all \\nTaxonomy-eligible expenditure is allocated to the two economic \\nactivities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5. There is no separable Taxon-\\nomy-eligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure for \\neconomic activity CE 5.4.  \\nIn most cases, values from financial data were allocated directly \\nto the economic activities for all three performance indicators, \\nbased for example on the drivetrain or the vehicle model. In the \\nremaining cases, an allocation mechanism was used for each \\neconomic activity and each performance indicator. For Taxon-\\nomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure for eco-\\nnomic activity CCM 3.3, the allocator is based on long-term Tax-\\nonomy-aligned revenues generated f rom the Automotive and \\nMotorcycles segment: \\n― Allocator for economic activity CCM 3.3: Proportion (BEV + \\nPHEV [<50 g CO2]) x Automotive segment revenues \\n(2024–2029)* \\nThe allocator is based on detailed long-term corporate planning \\nfor the next six years, as approved each year by the Board of \\nManagement and Supervisory Board.

Regardless of the Taxonomy require-\\nments, the BMW Group regularly and comprehensively ad-\\ndresses risks arising from climate change and their potential im-\\npact on its sites and supply chains. ↗ DNSH adaptation to climate \\nchange, ↗ TCFD climate risks \\n― BMW Group perspective \\nAll three performance indicators have grown markedly on \\nthe previous year at BMW Group level, highlighting that the \\nBMW Group is on the right track with its sustainable eco-\\nnomic activities relating to the EU Taxonomy. \\nTaxonomy-aligned revenues of the BMW Group amounted \\nto € 23,690 million (2022: € 15,705 million), correspond-\\ning to 15% of total Group revenues and an increase on the \\nprevious year of four percentage points. The Taxonomy-\\naligned share of capital expenditure was 26% (€ 7,926 mil-\\nlion), which corresponds to an increase of almost five per-\\ncentage points on 2022. Taxonomy-aligned capital ex-\\npenditure as a proportion of the BMW Group’s total capital \\nexpenditure is impacted significantly by additions related to \\nleased products. Consequently, an examination of the pro-\\nportion of Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure at BMW \\nGroup level does not reflect the huge investment in sustain-\\nable economic activities and products. Operating expendi-\\nture incurred for Taxonomy-aligned economic activities \\namounted to € 2,051 million, corresponding to over 31% of \\nTaxonomy-eligible operating expenditu re (2022: 29%). \\n↗ Voluntary additional information on the Taxonomy -aligned share per \\neconomic activity \\n― Economic activity CCM 3.3, “Manufacture of low-carbon \\ntechnologies for transport” \\nThe Taxonomy-aligned share of revenues generated by the \\nAutomotive and Motorcycles segment corresponded to \\n15.0% (economic activity CCM 3.3 “Manufacture of low-\\ncarbon technologies for transport”) of total Group revenues \\n(2022: 10.7%). As a percentage of third-party revenues of \\nthe two segments, the Taxonomy- aligned share rose  to \\n22.1% (2022: 15.7%). As a result, revenues from the Au-\\ntomotive and Motorcycles segment that are associated with \\nthe manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport \\n(CCM 3.3) increased by approximately 41%. In contrast to \\nthe previous year, revenues from pre-owned vehicles in the \\nAutomotive segment are reported under the new economic \\nactivity CE 5.4, somewhat dampening the rise in Taxonomy-\\naligned revenues. ↗ Segment information \\nThe Taxonomy-aligned proportion of capital expenditure in \\nthe Automotive and Motorcycles segment rose to 22.7% \\nfrom 19.1% in the previous year. Looking only at the Tax-\\nonomy-aligned additions to intangible assets and property, \\nplant and equipment in the context of additions recorded by \\nthe Automotive and Motorcycles segment, however, gives \\nrise to a considerably higher proportion of Taxonomy-\\naligned capital expenditure of more than 60%. Segment-\\nspecific capital expenditure is thus around 17 percentage \\npoints higher than in the previous year. This was driven by \\nincreased investment in sustainable products and plant in-\\nfrastructure as part of electrification. This underscores the \\nBMW Group’s extensive capital expenditure on sustainable \\nproducts and technologies. ↗ Voluntary additional information on \\nthe Taxonomy-aligned share per economic activity \\n― Economic activity CCM 6.5, “Transport by motorbikes, \\npassenger cars and light commercial vehicles” \\nThe Taxonomy-aligned shares for the three performance in-\\ndicators are at a low single-digit level for the Financial Ser-\\nvices segment. This is due to the fact that there is a time lag \\nbefore the effects of the ve hicle fleet electrification ramp-up \\nare reflected in the financing and leasing lines of business. \\nA further r eason is the varied, stricter DNSH requirements \\nfor economic activity CCM 6.5, in particular those relat ing to \\nEnvironmental Objective V “ Pollution p revention a nd con-\\ntrol”, which lead to the exclusion of almost all PHEV and a \\nsignificant restriction in the recognition of BEV (for details \\nsee section ↗ Do no significant harm). Third-party brands are \\nnot included in the vehicle portfolio in the reporting on Tax-\\nonomy alignment for economic activity CCM 6. 5. A la ck of \\navailable data regarding the tyre categories or WLTP emis-\\nsions values of th ird-party products makes it impossible to \\nreview compliance with the DNSH criteria in full. Moreover, \\nrev\\nenues from the sale of l ease returns are reported under \\nthe new economic activity CE 5.4, differently from the previ-\\nous ye ar. The Financial S ervices s egm ent recorded a d e-\\ncline in r evenues for 2023 in a bsolute te rms following the \\nreallocation of revenue components to the new economic \\nactivity CE 5.4. The Taxonomy-aligned proportion of capital \\nexpenditure in the Financial Services segm ent rose by more \\nthan 50% on the previous year to 3.3% (€ 1,018 million). \\nBased on total capital expenditure in the Financial Services \\nsegment, the Taxonomy-aligned proportion rose by signifi-\\ncan\\ntly more than 40% to 5.4%. ↗ Voluntary additional information \\non the Taxonomy-aligned share per economic activity \\n― Economic activity CE 5.4, “Sale of second-hand goods” \\nAs stipulated by Delegated Regulation 2023/2486, the \\nBMW Group only reports on the Taxonomy- eligible propor-\\ntion of revenues for economic activity CE 5.4. This economic \\nactivity includes revenues from pre-owned vehicles in the \\nAutomotive segment and revenues from the sale of used \\ncars after their intended use by clients in the Financial Ser-\\nvices segment, but does not include revenues from the sale \\nof used motorcycles.

This plan has been approved by \\nthe Board of Management of BMW AG and covers a seven-year \\nperiod (2023–2029). The CapEx plan covers capital expenditure \\nand operating expenditure for the reporting year and planned \\ncapital expenditure and operating expenditure (only non-capital-\\nised development costs) for 2023–2029 for economic activities \\nCCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5. The selected future period corresponds \\nto the detailed long-term corporate planning of the BMW  Group \\nand contains various investment measures with different imple-\\nmentation times (e.g. electrification of the vehicle fleet, model re-\\nvisions, structural investments in production sites).

The driver interacts \\nwith the vehicle via the BMW Panoramic Vision, the central dis-\\nplay unit and multifunctional buttons on the steering wheel. The \\nuser experience is complemented by the tried-and-tested voice \\ncontrol system via the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The \\nnext generation of the BMW iDrive thus offers a modern interpre-\\ntation of the brand’s typical driver-oriented focus. Similar to the \\nBMW iDrive controller that was formerly on the centre console or \\nthe BMW head -up display, the brand is setting new standards \\nwith the BMW Panoramic Vision, which will be available for the \\nfirst time in the NEUE KLASSE. It projects information at a height \\nideally aligned with the driver's line of sight and, for the first time, \\nacross the entire width of the windscreen. This innovation will \\ncomplement the enhanced BMW head-up display in the NEUE \\nKLASSE series models. \\nThe BMW VISION Neue Klasse is also characterised by the in-\\ncreased use of secondary raw materials, resource-friendly pro-\\nduction methods and an electric drive system featuring sixth-\\ngeneration BMW eDrive technology.  \\nThe BMW VISION Neue Klasse represents the entire range of \\ntechnological innovations with which the BMW Group is under-\\nlining its future entrepreneurial viability. It stands for the dawn of \\na new era of individual mobility: electric, digital and circular. \\nDigitalisation stands for innovation and customer focus \\nDigitalisation is a key element in keeping the vehicle constantly \\nup to date for customers long after they have taken delivery of \\ntheir new automobile. Since the launch of Operating System 7 in \\n2018, remote software upgrades1 have been available for BMW \\nvehicles. Apart from these software upgrades, the BMW Group \\nalso releases new functions and features on an ongoing basis. \\nAt the end of 2023, over six million BMW vehicles worldwide \\nwere already fully updatable. In other words, these vehicles can \\nbe updated in every respect, including infotainment, the drive \\nsystem, driver assistance, convenience and safety. The BMW \\nGroup can currently update over 30 derivatives of all its drive var-\\niants remotely over the air. \\nBMW ConnectedDrive upgrades also allow additional functions \\nto be either bought or simply booked for a specific period after \\nthe vehicle has been initially purchased. \\nThe vehicle as a digital experience \\nThe latest generation of BMW Group vehicles offers customers a \\nmaximum of interaction, infotainment and connectivity. State-of-\\nthe-art on- and off-board technologies such as 5G connectivity \\nand cloud services make the latest BMW vehicles an integral part \\nof their users’ digital ecosystems. The comprehensive connectiv-\\nity enables a whole host of digital services and functions, from \\nsmart and learning navigation to in -car gaming and video \\nstreaming. The vehicle is thus becoming the ”next living space” \\nfor its users. \\nWith the further development of the BMW iDrive in 2023 and the \\n”QuickSelect” fast access concept, an improved menu structure \\nbased on devices from the consumer electronics sector is being \\nadded to the system. With the right information in the right place, \\nthe new BMW iDrive provides users with a concentrated, confi-\\ndent driving experience. The latest BMW iDrive generation is \\nbased on the BMW Operating System 8.5 and BMW Operating \\nSystem 9.2 \\nThe latest MINI vehicles in the “New MINI Family” also incorpo-\\nrate these technology modules and, with the MINI Operating \\nSystem 9, offer their customers an unmistakable digital user ex-\\nperience typical for the MINI brand. The iconic, round OLED dis-\\nplay takes centre stage in this concept. \\nSoftware expertise at the BMW Group \\nMore than twenty years ago, with the founding of BMW Car IT \\nthe BMW Group began developing its own soft ware Since then, \\nthe company has continued to expand its teams of developers to \\nform a global network. Beginning with the Ulm site in southern \\nGermany, its software expertise has been bolstered by the joint \\nventures Critical TechWorks in Portugal and BA TechWorks in \\nChina. \\nDigital connectivity and automation \\nAutomated functions and digitally connected vehicles can help \\ncut emissions, reduce the risk of accidents and ease traffic con-\\ngestion. That’s why the BMW Group is consistently driving this \\nissue forward – with a sharp focus on customer convenience and \\nsafety. \\nTo ensure the safety of automated systems, the BMW Group is \\npromoting the development of industry -wide ISO standards for \\npartially, highly and fully automated driving functions. The wor k \\non classifying the standardisation of SAE 3 Level 3 and Level 4 \\nfunctions has resulted in an ISO technical report that is due to be \\npublished as an ISO technical specification in 2024. Further-\\nmore, in 2023 an ISO PAS standard was published that supports \\nthe introduction of Level 2 systems with innovative driver inte-\\ngration. The documents define uniform technical standards for \\nsafe assisted and automated driving. \\n1 The availability and contents of remote software upgrades depends on the country, model, equip-\\nment and software version installed. \\n2 The use of OS 8.5 and OS 9 depends on the vehicle class and the production period. \\n3 SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) levels categorise the degree of automation from manual \\nto autonomous driving in five stages. \\n4 ↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures. \\n4\"),\n",

With the help of virtual simulations and \\nreal-life testing, all driving situations are covered, whether in the \\ncity, in the country, on the highway or when parking. We are thus \\ncreating the basis for meeting our customers’ high safety stand-\\nards when it comes to automated driving. We also operate re-\\nsearch facilities in Munich, where we were involved in the \\n↗ TEMPUS* research project in collaboration with the city authori-\\nties. Between 2021 and 2023, we gathered practical experience \\non a wide range of use cases relating to automated driving func-\\ntions and innovative mobility services in urban areas. The BMW \\nGroup also has research facilities located in China and the USA, \\nenabling it to integrate its two largest markets with regard to \\nroad- and traffic law-related issues right from the outset. \\nThe new BMW 5 Series sets new standards in terms of digital \\nconnectivity and automation. Among other things, the vehicle \\ncan be optionally equipped with a highway assistant, which per-\\nmanently takes over distance control and steering tasks and, for \\nthe first time, actively changes lanes when confirmed by the \\ndriver’s gaze. \\nFollowing recent approval by the Federal Motor Transport Au-\\nthority, the new BMW 7 Series will be equipped with Level 3 func-\\ntions for the first time. The option will be available as of March \\n2024, making the BMW Group one of the leading automobile \\nmanufacturers in the field of highly automated driving. \\nDrivetrain technologies of the future \\nWhen developing drive system technologies, the BMW Group \\nconsiders the needs of its customers worldwide. For this reason \\nwe are constantly developing existing drivetrain technologies in \\nthe interests of efficiency, decarbonisation and resource conser-\\nvation. At the same time, we continue to research new drivetrain \\ntechnologies with the ultimate aim of developing them for series \\nproduction. \\nNew generation of battery cells \\nHigh-performance, innovative and sustainably produced battery \\ncells are the key to success for individual electric mobility. With its \\nNEUE KLASSE models, as of 2025 the BMW Group will be using \\nnewly developed, round battery cells for the first time, which are \\noptimally coordinated to suit the new architecture. The sixth gen-\\neration of our lithium-ion cells represents a giant technological \\nleap forward compared with the previous generation, effectively \\nincreasing energy density by more than 20%, charging speed by \\nup to 30% and range by around 30%. The carbon emissions \\ngenerated by cell production will be reduced by up to 60%. \\nElectrified vehicles as part of the power grid \\nThe BMW Group is conducting its own research and develop-\\nment work with the aim of integrating electrified vehicles in the \\npower grid. The focus is on technologies such as smart charging, \\na key component of the ↗ BMW ChargeForward service, which en-\\nables customers to synchronise their charging behaviour with the \\ncurrent grid load and the use of renewable energy. The technol-\\nogy has been available to all drivers of electrified vehicles in the \\nUSA since November 2023. Another cross-sectoral project \\nknown as ↗ Bidirectional Charging Management (BCM) was successfully \\ncompleted at the end of 2022. Over a period of three years, the \\nBMW Group, together with grid operators and universities, tested \\nhow electric vehicles can become mobile energy storage units \\nand thus part of the power grid system. The results of the project \\nunderline the great potential of bidirectional charging and were \\nincorporated in an initial customer offering, Connected Home \\nCharging, in 2023. The project is a strategic cooperation with the \\ngrid operator E.ON, which aims to establish a Europe-wide eco-\\nsystem for smart charging at home. The innovation enables cus-\\ntomers to connect their electrified BMW or MINI vehicle with their \\nsmart home and the power grid. The service has been available \\nin an initial expansion stage in several European countries since \\nlate 2023. In the coming years, it is to be expanded and ex-\\ntended to include additional scope with the ultimate aim of ena-\\nbling bidirectional charging as well. \\n[[ BMW Highway Assistant and Active Lane Change \\nIn the new BMW 5 Series Sedan, customers can use the BMW Highway \\nAssistant and Active Lane Change feature for the first time. The BMW \\nHighway Assistant enables drivers to take their hands off the steering \\nwheel and place them in a comfortable position when driving for pro-\\nlonged distances. The function is also supplemented by a new feature: \\nthe Active Lane Change assistant with driver’s gaze confirmation, \\nwhich enables the vehicle to change lanes automatically without the \\ndriver having to touch the steering wheel. All the driver needs to do is \\nglance at the wing m irrors to confirm the lane change. The prerequi-\\nsites for this technology include high -precision sensors, a powerful \\ncomputing platform and connection to the BMW Cloud. \\nTake your hands off the steering wheel and temporarily turn your at-\\ntention away from the traffic situation – this is highly automated driving \\nat Level 3 and can be experienced in new BMW 7 Series models as of \\nMarch 2024. BMW Personal Pilot L3 is the name of the new function \\nthat relieves customers of the task of driving in defined traffic situa-\\ntions and regulates speed, distance and lane guidance for them. The \\ninnovative system enables drivers to engage in secondary activities \\n(such as writing messages or watching video streaming) on highways \\nwith structurally separated lanes and at speeds of up to 60 km/h. ]] \\n'),\n",

Our holistic activities \\ncomprise the following three pillars and underline the \\nBMW Group’s commitment to innovation: \\n― Corporate: The virtualisation of internal processes, methods \\nand products with real-time collaboration, regardless of \\nlocation \\nFor example, as part of the iFactory, planners can use vir-\\ntual reality to virtually assess buildings, systems, logistics \\nand the assembly of new production areas and test pro-\\ncesses in 3D, long before construction is scheduled to \\nbegin.\\n― Commercial: Interaction with both new and existing tech -\\ns\\navvy target groups in virtual spaces and virtual worlds. \\nEngagement on digital platforms enables experience -\\noriented interaction with young target groups (Gen Z) within \\ntheir digital ecosystems with the aim of enhancing brand \\nimage and developing long- term customer loyalty. In \\ndedicated virtual worlds such as the BMW Motorrad \\nMetaRide, innovative products can be experienced in a new \\nway and supported throughout the entire customer journey. \\n― In-car experiences: Enhancing the quality of experience with \\na focus on infotainment, productivity and gaming. \\nWith the M Mixed Reality approach, for example, a team of \\nengineers at BMW M GmbH has developed an immersive \\ndriving experience for the BMW M2 and M4, which is now \\nbeing made available to Driving Experience customers for \\nthe first time. Wearing VR goggles, drivers can be immersed \\nin a virtual world while driving the real vehicle. In addition, \\nthe BMW Group has made further inroads into the gaming \\nscene with the launch of Air Console, i.e. casual gaming in \\nnumerous current BMW and MINI models. \\nArtificial intelligence \\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly \\ndeveloped and performs ever more comprehensive tasks. GPTs \\n(Generative Pretrained Transformers) support and accelerate \\noperational processes, including creative tasks. The technology \\nholds considerable potential for the way we work, collaborate, \\ndevelop, share knowledge and interact with our customers and \\nhow the future experience within our vehicles will be designed. \\nThe development of generative AI is still in its infancy and indus-\\ntrialisation has only just begun. We are already using the first \\ntools based on this technology or investigating its potential for \\nspecific applications, such as: \\n― Image-generating AI for end -to-end support of our design \\nand vehicle construction processes \\n― Large language models, such as those on which ChatGPT \\nis based, for voice applications within the vehicle \\n― Text and image generation applications, as well as \\nknowledge management based on large language models \\nfor exploration for all employees \\n― Application of generative AI in various processes at the \\nBMW Group, such as: \\n― Market and sales communication, e.g. generated \\nmarketing texts \\n― Knowledge management for customer interaction in call \\ncentres \\n― Knowledge management or comparison of offers in \\npurchasing \\n― Testing and comparison of vehicle specifications \\n― Coding support for IT and vehicle development  \\nShaping the future of mobility \\nTh\\ne BMW Group is involved in numerous research and imple-\\nmentation projects for developing new mobility concepts. The \\nmain focus is on ↗ pilot projects that improve the quality of life and \\npromote more sustainable urban mobility. In Munich, we are co-\\ninitiators of the new ↗ Mobile Future Alliance Munich . Together with \\npolicymakers, the Technical University of Munich and the Munich \\nTransport and Tariff Association, a strategy for sustainable mo-\\nbility in the greater Munich area is to be developed. Specifically, \\nit is about using street space more efficiently, creating open \\nspaces for liveable urban areas, establishing new mobility solu-\\ntions and promoting parking space management, among other \\nthings. \\nIn Rotterdam, we are working with the city authorities, Erasmus \\nUniversity and other local partners on various pilot projects, in-\\ncluding the improved interconnectedness of different modes of \\ntransport (intermodality), visionary urban vehicle concepts and \\nthe more efficient use of charging infrastructure. The BMW Group \\nalso held a ↗ stakeholder dialogue together with the City of Rotter-\\ndam in the reporting year. Over 100 participants from city admin-\\nistrations, the scientific community, industry and start-ups from \\nEurope, the USA and China discussed the urban mobility of the \\nfuture. The findings are now being incorpo rated into other pro-\\njects. '),\n",

The \\nglobal network of BMW Group Technology Offices is also making \\nan essential contribution to maintaining the Group’s leading role \\nin terms of innovation. \\nThese offices are strategically positioned worldwide and focus \\non key hotspots of technology and innovation. The potential of \\nnew technologies is therefore being explored in pilot projects and \\ntransferred to the Group’s centralised teams. Whether manufac-\\nturing, developing smart city solutions or the mobility of the fu-\\nture, these Technology Offices are driving forward innovations \\nthat benefit the Group in all its lines of business. \\nGlobal dialogue with start -ups is an important means for the \\nBMW Group to gain impetus. This is based on three pillars, com-\\nprising ↗ BMW i Ventures  (through which we invest in technology \\nstart-ups), the start-up ↗ Platform URBAN-X (a MINI brand-initiated \\nstart-up that focuses primarily on urban living) and the ↗ BMW \\nStartup Garage. The latter serves as the BMW Group’s venture cli-\\nent unit and is tasked with searching for innovations that repre-\\nsent a significant benefit for products, services, systems and pro-\\ncesses. The aim of the programme is to evaluate and empower \\nstart-ups to become suppliers and partners. \\nThe trend research conducted by the technology offices enables \\nthe BMW Group to anticipate the technological developments of \\ntomorrow. The results are made publicly available in the ↗ Trend \\nRadar where sci entific institutions, start -ups, but also potential \\npartners can make use of them. \\nWhen it opened in Silicon Valley in 1998, the BMW Group Tech-\\nnology Office USA was the Group’s first research and develop-\\nment facility to be established outside of Munich. Originally \\nbased in Palo Alto, the BMW tech office moved to its current lo-\\ncation in Mountain View in 2011. Today, the Mountain View \\nteam is part of a global network of BMW tech offices strategically \\nlocated in key technology hotspots around the world. They all \\nplay a crucial role in the BMW Group’s open approach to innova-\\ntion. Apart from the locations in Silicon Valley and Munich, the \\nworldwide network also includes Seoul, Shanghai, Tel Aviv and \\nTokyo. \\nWorldwide cooperations and partnerships \\nTo ensure its long-term success, the BMW Group enters into tar-\\ngeted cooperations and partnerships with companies from vari-\\nous industries Several of the Group’s largest collaborations and \\ninvestments are listed below: \\nSince 2022, the BMW Group and Qualcomm Technologies have \\nbeen working together to develop solutions for the next genera-\\ntion of automated driving. The three companies aim to develop \\ntechnologies ranging from New Car Assessment Program \\n(NCAP) solutions and advanced Level 2 driving assistance sys-\\ntems to the Level 3 functionalities of highly automated driving. \\nThe joint development of software functions is based on BMW’s \\ncurrent software toolkit for automated driving. Within the terms \\nof the cooperation, ultimately some 1,300 specialists will work \\ntogether at various locations worldwide, including sites in Ger-\\nmany, the USA, Sweden, China, Romania and the BMW Test \\nCentre in Sokolov in the Czech Republic. \\nThe HERE mapping service was acquired by BMW, Mercedes -\\nBenz and Audi in 2015. Continental, Intel, Mitsubishi, Nippon \\nTelegraph and Telephone, and Pioneer are also current share-\\nholders. The participation in HERE ensures long-term access to \\nscalable, high-resolution maps. The development of a central-\\nised, more efficient geo-database, from which all HERE products \\n(including the currently used SD navigation map and HD maps) \\ncan be fed and continuously updated, was completed in 2023. \\nIn collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the \\nBMW Group is developing innovative cloud technologies for pro-\\ncessing vehicle data. The two companies are also working to-\\ngether to develop commercial standard cloud solutions for the \\nsecure handling of vehicle data. The agreement is a continuation \\nof the partnership in the field of vehicle data that began back in \\n2015. As in all previous collaborations with AWS, the \\nBMW Group retains full and exclusive control over the data and \\ncomplies with the data protection regulations applicable in its re-\\nspective markets. \\nSince the launch of the first BMW voice assistant (BMW Intelli-\\ngent Personal Assistant) in 2018, voice interaction has become \\nan increasingly important part of the BMW iDrive display and op-\\nerating concept. The next generation of the voice assistant will \\nbe based on Amazon’s Alexa technology, thus enabling an even \\nmore natural dialogue between driver and vehicle.  \\nThe BMW Group is continuously building on its various coopera-\\ntion arrangements aimed at expanding charging infrastructure in \\ngeneral. In addition to the BMW Group, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, \\nPorsche, Volkswagen, Audi, Hyundai/Kia and BlackRock are all \\ninvolved in the long-established IONITY joint venture. The aim is \\nto set up an efficient, high -power charging network for electric \\nvehicles right across Europe. \\nOn 19 October 2023, the BMW  Group jointly founded a com-\\npany together with General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mer-\\ncedes-Benz and Stellantis. The partners are working together \\nwith the aim of establishing a public charging network in the USA \\nand Canada. \\nOn 6 November 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement \\nwith Mercedes-Benz to establish a company based in China with \\nthe objective of building charging infrastructure in that market. \\nThe approval by the antitrust authorities has already been given. \\nThe BMW Group holds a 50% stake in the recently founded \\ncompany. ↗ Reliable and comprehensive charging opportunities '),\n",

The BMW Group’s range of services \\nalso includes comprehensive charging solutions for the home, \\nthe workplace and on the road. ↗ Reliable and comprehensive charging \\nopportunities \\nPRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY \\nAll BMW Group products and services are required to meet the \\nhighest standards in terms of quality and safety, People’s safety \\nhas top priority, right from the product development stage. With \\nthis point in mind, optimum chassis tuning, highly effective brak-\\ning systems and stable passenger compartments are key fac-\\ntors. Moreover, BMW Group vehicles are equipped with state-of-\\nthe-art safety systems that reduce the risk of accidents and inju-\\nries (active safety systems such as collision warning or lane de-\\nparture warning systems) as well as mitigate the consequences \\nin the event of an accident (passive safety systems such as air-\\nbags or seat belts). \\nWe are also working continuously to further improve the safety of \\nour vehicles. In 2023, the new BMW 5 Series achieved top marks \\nin the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP). \\nThe new BMW i5 * was also named ”Safest car of the year” by \\nthe Korean New Car Assessment Programme (KNCAP). Further \\nawards gained in 2023 included the “Top Safety Pick+” from the \\nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS, USA) for the new \\nBMW 5 Series, the BMW X3 and the BMW X1, as well as a triple \\n“Good” rating in the China Insurance Automotive Safety Index (C-\\nIASI) for the BMW X1. ↗ GRI Index: 416-1 ↗ SASB Index \\nQuality management \\nIn addition to its high quality and compliance with statutory reg-\\nulations and standards, the BMW Group’s comprehensive quality \\nmanagement system also focuses on ensuring the safety of its \\nproducts. From the development stage to manufacturing, they \\nare therefore subject to rigorous testing procedures. Further-\\nmore, any information received from customers regarding poten-\\ntial deviations from quality standards are systematically followed \\nup. \\nIf a safety risk or a compliance-related defect is found, the BMW \\nGroup implements all the measures required to remedy the issue \\nfollowing detailed discussions with the relevant authorities. In \\n2023, safety- and compliance-related technical campaigns af-\\nfected around 1.8 million vehicles (2022: 3.4 million vehicles). All \\nthese actions were voluntary and carried out in coordination with \\nthe authorities concerned. The BMW  Group works according to \\nthe principle of prevention. To avoid technical campaigns of this \\ntype going forward, the BMW Group has also developed a com-\\nprehensive programme that has been in place since 2023. \\nPollutants management \\nTo the extent possible, the BMW Group excludes the use of prob-\\nlematic substances right from the vehicle design stage and sets \\nout corresponding stipulations for its suppliers. Guidance is pro-\\nvided in the form of the ↗ Global Automotive Declarable Substance List \\n(GADSL). At the same time, we are working to reduce pollutant \\nemissions in the interior of our vehicles to an absolute minimum. \\nAll BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are equipped as \\nstandard with interior air filters that prevent exterior pollutants \\nand particles such as dust or pollen from entering the vehicle. \\nSince 2020, the BMW Group has been using air filters equipped \\nwith nanofibre technology that are specially designed to prevent \\ncertain microbial particles and allergens as well as ultra-fine par-\\nticulate matter from entering the vehicle. \\n* ↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.

In 2023, more than 110,000 \\ncustomers worldwide took part in these training courses. \\nCustomer data protection \\nRight from the early stages of developing its functions and ser-\\nvices, the BMW Group sets out strict requirements for data pro-\\ntection due to the growing IT risks. Any personal data required in \\nthe course of contact with our customers are only collected, pro-\\ncessed or used to the extent legally permitted and with the active \\nconsent of the data subject. \\nIn order to ensure the protection of custome r data, despite the \\nchallenge posed by the growing number of digitalised services, \\nwe are constantly developing our data management systems \\nand respond promptly to any information received regarding \\ndata protection risks. If customers have any queries regarding \\nthe processing of their personal data, they can contact the Cus-\\ntomer Interaction Centre or the Data Protection Officer in their re-\\nspective market. With the aim of maintaining our high level of \\ndata protection, we regularly check all applications that process \\ncustomer data to ensure full implementation of all current and \\nappropriate IT security measures. Teams of experts also search \\nspecifically for any vulnerabilities in existing applications. We also \\ntranslate any new findings into binding, Group-wide standards. \\nThe BMW Group collaborates closely with the relevant data pro-\\ntection supervisory authorities – particularly regarding funda-\\nmental data protection issues such as those arising from the in-\\ncreasing connectivity of vehicles. ↗ GRI Index: 3-3, 418-1 \\nSecure connectivity \\nThe BMW Group’s responsibility for its products includes the se-\\ncure transmission of vehicle data to third parties. For example, \\nGroup vehicles are not directly connected to the Internet, but \\ncommunicate directly and exclusively with the BMW Connect-\\nedDrive back-end facilities via a secure connection within a vir-\\ntual private network. The strategy enables the BMW  Group to \\nminimise the risk of unauthorised third parties accessing either \\nthe vehicle itself or any of its sensitive data. The access point to \\nthe Internet is controlled via a gateway. We currently see this ex-\\ntended vehicle approach in accordance with ISO 20078 as the \\nbest solution for offering an outstanding level of data security and \\ndata protection and meeting the statutory cybersecurity require-\\nments (e.g. UN R155). \\n↗ CarData provides BMW and MINI customers with transparency \\nand sovereignty over the transfer of data to authorised third par-\\nties.

We are taking ambitious \\nsteps to contribute to progressive decarbonisation, and have \\ntherefore developed a carbon reduction strategy based on a ho-\\nlistic approach. \\nFor the BMW Group, holistic means decarbonising the emissions \\ngenerated by its vehicles over their entire life cycle. Although the \\ngradual electrification of the Group’s fleet is contributing towards \\ndecarbonisation during the use phase, emissions are also in-\\ncreasing at the same time, particularly in t he supply chain. The \\nmain reason for this is the carbon -intensive production of com-\\nponents such as high-voltage batteries. Reducing carbon emis-\\nsions within the supply chain is therefore one of our main selec-\\ntion criteria when awarding contracts to suppliers. With this strat-\\negy, the BMW Group is making a vital contribution to decarbon-\\nising the entire life cycle of its products, including energy-inten-\\nsive raw materials such as steel, light metals and plastics. The \\napproach also helps reduce carbon emissions across various \\nsectors. ↗ Carbon emissions in the supply chain \\nThe BMW Group’s decarbonisation  targets are part of its inte-\\ngrated corporate target system and validated by the Science \\nBased Targets initiative (SBTi). They are being implemented \\nunder the responsibility of the Board of Management in the BMW \\nGroup’s various departments and thus throughout the organisa-\\ntion ↗ Performance Indicators and Performance Management. Specific de-\\ncarbonisation targets are derived from the overarching objectives \\nfor each vehicle project, with the aim of achieving substantial im-\\nprovements from one vehicle generation to the next. The respon-\\nsibility for achieving these goals lies with specialist units in the \\nmanagement areas of Development, Purchasing, Supplier Net-\\nwork, Production and Logistics. Internal control and reporting \\nsystems take into account the various stages in the value chain, \\ncomprising the supply chain, development, production and the \\nuse phase. Among other factors, our decarbonisation measures \\nare based on emissions specifications at material and compo-\\nnent level. Target management and the monitoring of target \\nachievement are performed at vehicle level and subsequently \\naggregated for reporting at Group level. \\nWe explain how the BMW Group manages the topic of sustaina-\\nbility across the organisation in the chapter ↗ The BMW Group \\nStrategy. We also report on t he management of climate -related \\nopportunities and risks in the chapters ↗ Outlook and ↗ Risks and \\nOpportunities. \\nReducing carbon emissions across the entire value chain \\nThe BMW  Group aims to achieve ↗ Net zero  carbon emissions \\nacross the entire value chain1 by no later than 2050. This objec-\\ntive is based on decarbonisation targets up to 2030 that were \\nvalidated in 2021 by the SBTi and are in line with the climate \\ntargets set out in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming. \\nBased on this commitment, we are part of the SBTi and the in-\\nternational ↗ Race to Zero Campaign led by the United Nations. \\nWe have set ourselves the following decarbonisation targets 2 to \\nbe achieved by 2030 (base year 2019 for each scope): \\n― Decarbonisation by an average of 80% per vehicl e \\nproduced at our own plants and sites (Scope 1 and 2) 3. \\nThese targets can be achieved, for example, by reducing our \\nenergy requirements and simultaneously increasing the use \\nof renewable energy.4 ↗ Carbon emissions of BMW Group locations \\n― Decarbonisation in the use phase 5 of the vehicle (Scope 3 \\ndownstream6) by an average of more than 50% per \\nkilometre driven.

For this reason, the \\nBMW Group will continue to work on improving the already hi gh \\nefficiency of its conventional drivetrains going forward through \\nthe use of innovative technologies as part of the Efficient Dynam-\\nics technology package. A key component in this respect is the \\nbroader use of 48-volt technology. 48-volt recuperation systems \\nuse the energy recovered when braking to supply the vehicle’s \\nelectrical system and generate additional propulsion, thereby re-\\nducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. In Europe, in ad-\\ndition to our all-electric models and plug-in hybrids, we offer nu-\\nmerous new model series that feature a 48 -volt recuperation \\nsystem. Since 2022, our modular engines have been fitted with \\nthe second, even more efficient generation of 48-volt technology. \\nThe further development of energy management in BMW Group \\nvehicles, alongside other measures such as switching to highly \\nefficient tyres, is designed to ensure additional efficiency and op-\\ntimised consumption figures. \\n1 EU-27 countries including Norway and Iceland. \\n2 Including an allowance for eco-innovations (with minor significance). \\n3 Average carbon emissions fleet-wide within the EU (including Norway and Iceland) are required \\nto be reported in accordance with the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure \\n(WLTP) type test cycle as of 2021. Since 2021, this metric has been used by the EU Commission \\nas the basis for calculating carbon fleet emissions.  \\n4 This is a preliminary internal calculation with a potential variation of +/- 0.5 g CO2/km, as official \\nregistration figures from the authorities are not available for all EU states. Figures officially pub-\\nlished by the EU Commission are not expected to be available until November of the following \\nyear.

Failure to remain below the regulatory limits results in negative credits. At \\nthe end of a model year, a positive GHG credit balance must be achieved in order to meet regula-\\ntory requirements. As GHG credits are valid for five years on the US market, a short-term failure to \\nmeet fleet-wide limit targets in one year can be compensated by undercutting them in a previous \\nyear. Moreover, it is possible to purchase credits from other manufacturers. In 2023, the BMW \\nGroup drew on existing credits from previous years. However, it did not purchase any external \\ncredits from other manufacturers.

The same applies to non -EU \\ncountries as for example Switzerland, Norway , the UK and Ice-\\nland, where comparable regulations apply.1 At the same time, the \\nBMW Group is already preparing for the introduction of the up-\\ncoming Euro 7 emissions standard, which is currently undergo-\\ning the legislative process and will include for the first time limits \\nfor brake particle emissions and tyre abrasion amongst other \\nthings. \\nThe level of nitrogen oxides is a crucial factor for air quality in \\ncities. For this reason, since mid-2018 the BMW Group has been \\nusing a highly effective combination of nitrogen oxide storage \\ncatalytic converters (NSCs) and selective catalytic reduction \\n(SCR) systems that include urea injection (AdBlue) in all BMW \\nvehicles as well as in the larger diesel-powered MINI models. \\nThe efficiency of exhaust gas aftertreatment has been further in-\\ncreased by the use of an improved oxidation catalyst in combi-\\nnation with a two -stage SCR system. The new technology has \\nbeen available since 2020 with the revised generation of six-cyl-\\ninder diesel engines and is currently being rolled out to other \\nmodels. There have already been signs of a reduction in NOx \\npollution in German cities over the last few years. Apart from var-\\nious measures taken to reduce pollutants, the ongoing renewal \\nof the vehicle fleets of all automobile manufacturers has also \\ncontributed to the improvement. ↗ GRI Index: 305-7 \\nELECTROMOBILITY \\nThe BMW Group sees the electrification of its model range as a \\nkey component of its product strategy to reduce fleet emissions \\nand thus achieve its ambitious strategic ↗ decarbonisation targets. \\nWe already provide our customers with an extensive range of all-\\nelectric, battery-powered vehicles (BEV). In 2023, another high-\\nvolume model, the all-electric BMW i52 business sedan, went on \\nsale. MINI presented the new all-electric MINI Cooper SE2 to the \\npublic during the year under report. The Rolls -Royce brand \\nlaunched its first all- electric model, the Rolls -Royce Spectre2, in \\n2023. The BMW  Group therefore has at least one all -electric \\nmodel in its range for all three premium brands and in all seg-\\nments. At the end of the reporting period, a total of 20 all-electric \\nmodels in ten different series were available to order from the \\nBMW Group. \\nDemand for all-electric vehicles rising \\nWith our growing range of all-electric models, we are serving a \\nrapidly increasing level of demand. Deliveries of all-electric cars \\nincreased significantly again year on year to 375,716 units \\n(2022: 215,752 units/+74.1%). The share of all-electric vehi-\\ncles to total deliveries was 14.7%, also significantly higher than \\nin the previous year (2022: 9.0%/+63.3%). Since the 2023 fi-\\nnancial year, this key figure has replaced the proportion of elec-\\ntrified vehicles, including PHEV vehicles, which was reported as \\na key performance indicator up to 2022. \\nAs of 2025, the Group will take its core BMW brand into a new, \\nconsistently all-electric era with the NEUE KLASSE. By the early \\n2030s, the MINI and Rolls-Royce brands will have an exclusively \\nall-electric product portfolio. The strategy will help to achieve a \\nshare of more than 50% of the BMW Group’s global sales with \\nall-electric vehicles – depending on certain framework conditions \\nsuch as the development of a comprehensive charging infra-\\nstructure by 2030. The BMW Group aims to have delivered more \\nthan 10 million all-electric vehicles to customers by 2030. \\n1 The other non-EU countries to which this statement applies are Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and \\nHerzegovina, Liechtenstein, Macau, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey. \\n2 ↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures. \\n2'),\n",

In addition to all -electric vehicles, our customers \\ncan therefore choose from a wide range of plug -in hybrids and \\nvehicles powered by efficient combustion engines. Our ↗ flexible \\nproduction systems and scalable modular vehicle system reflect our \\nrigorous focus on customer needs. With the  launch of the new \\nBMW i51, a further model series is now available with all three \\ntypes of drive system, which previously applied to the BMW X1, \\nBMW X3, BMW 3 Series and the BMW 7 Series. \\nAt the BMW Group, customer -oriented technological diversity \\nalso includes the ongoing development of fuel cell technology. \\nDepending on the segment, we see hydrogen-powered electric \\nvehicles as a potentially key alternative to battery-powered elec-\\ntric mobility and thus as an opportunity to reduce carbon emis-\\nsions even more quickly. ↗ Hydrogen-powered pilot fleet  operating \\nsuccessfully \\nDesigning electric vehicle ranges to match user behaviour \\nThe BMW Group assesses the increase in the electric ranges of \\nits vehicles from various points of view. Our main approach is to \\noptimally adapt vehicle ranges to the respective purpose of use \\nand user behaviour. With this strategy we also take into account \\nthe environmental impact, as greater range also means deploy-\\ning larger and therefore heavier high-voltage batteries. This re-\\nlationship has an effect on resource consumption and the carbon \\nfootprint of the supply chain as well as the vehicle’s weight and \\ntherefore its electricity consumption. \\nThe new all-electric MINI Cooper SE 1, which is mainly designed \\nfor urban use, has a customer-focused range of around 400 kil-\\nometres (WLTP2). The new BMW i5 1 can achieve a range of up \\nto 582 km in the statutory WLTP test cycle, depending on factors \\nsuch as equipment and type of motor. With offers such as the \\nBMW eDrive Zone, attractive electricity tariffs for driving, charg-\\ning equipment, the integration of charging in the vehicle app and \\nincreased ranges, we are helping drivers of plug-in hybrids to \\ndrive electrically as frequently and over as long a distance as \\npossible. For instance, the BMW X5 Plug-in-Hybrid1 from the \\ncompact segment can cover up to 110 kilometres (WLTP2) solely \\non battery power. \\nThinking holistically about electric mobility \\nThe BMW Group’s electrified vehicles are characterised  by their \\nhigh efficiency and low consumption. However, the BMW  Group \\nhas greater aspirations:  its vehicles need to be as eco- friendly \\nas possible, not only during their locally carbon -free use phase, \\nbut also in terms of their overall footprint, including the supply \\nchain and production. ↗ Carbon Emissions Unlike conventional com-\\nbustion engine -powered vehicles, the environmental impact of \\nbattery-powered automobiles lies predominantly in the up-\\nstream value chain. Where the use of natural raw materials to \\nmanufacture battery cells and the carbon-intensive production of \\nbatteries make a significant impact. \\nIt is therefore particularly important to the BMW Group to include \\nenvironmental and social aspects in the production of compo-\\nnents such as electric motors, high-voltage storage systems and \\nbattery cells. ↗ Carbon emissions in the supply chain, ↗ Social and ecological \\nresponsibility. Other approaches to mitigating the environmental \\nimpacts include increasing the use of recycling and reusing high-\\nvoltage storage units from our BEV and PHEV models in an ap-\\npropriate manner. The BMW Group offers customers who pur-\\nchase its battery-powered vehicles the option to take back their \\nhigh-voltage batteries free of charge. The offer also applies to \\nmarkets where take-back is not mandatory by law. \\nReliable, comprehensive charging opportunities \\nAn expanded, customer-friendly charging infrastructure will pave \\nthe way for the rapid and widespread use of electric mobility. With \\nthe adoption of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation \\n(AFIR) in 2023, the EU resolved to set up a basic network of both \\nelectric charging stations and hydrogen filling stations by the end \\nof 2030. From the BMW Group’s point of view, this is a first key \\nstep towards providing a customer-friendly charging infrastruc-\\nture.

For these reasons, \\nthe BMW Group is taking further steps to increase the proportion \\nof recycled materials in its products and thus reduce its depend-\\nence on primary raw materials. The BMW Group is also continu-\\nally enhancing its local supply chains in line with the “local for \\nlocal” principle. At all levels of in -house production, we remain \\ncommitted to consistently conserving resources, continuously \\nimproving energy efficiency and further reducing carbon emis-\\nsions. \\nClosing material loops  \\nThe BMW Group pursues the strategic aim of  reducing the pro-\\nportion of primary materials in its value chain. An important start-\\ning point in this endeavour is to close cycles for certain materials \\nand components. With this objective in mind, the BMW Group re-\\nturns selected production residues to the supplier, enabling \\nthose materials to be recovered and reused in a new production \\nprocess. At the BMW Group, the circular economy principle (“De-\\nsign for Circularity”) is already being implemented as an opera-\\ntional concept in the design of the NEUE KLASSE by the corpo-\\nrate function “Total Vehicle Development” and systematically \\napplied in the development of new vehicle models. \\nThe BMW Group already uses a certain extent, depending on the \\nvehicle, of recycled and reused materials to manufacture its ve-\\nhicles. In line with the “Secondary First” approach, we aim to in-\\ncrease the use of secondary materials going forward, taking both \\ntechnical feasibility and market availability into account. Within \\nthe framework of selected product, material and supplier require-\\nments, we have therefore decided to give preference to second-\\nary materials in our future vehicles. All secondary and primary \\nmaterials used bythe BMW  Group must meet the same high \\nstandards of quality, safety and reliability. \\n↗ GRI Index: 3-3 ↗ Average \\ndistribution of materials in BMW Group vehicles \\nThe BMW i Vision Circular vehicle is emblematic of our ambitions \\nand made entirely from recycled or renewable raw materials. The \\nNEUE KLASSE is also consistent with this vision in that the com-\\nponents cobalt, lithium and nickel used to produce battery cells \\nwill in future contain a certain percentage of secondary materials, \\nthus reducing the volume of primary materials needed and miti-\\ngating the associated negative environmental impacts. The \\nNEUE KLASSE will also contain a higher proportion of secondary \\nmaterials in other material groups such as steel and aluminium. \\nAt the same time, we promote the recovery of end -of-life vehi-\\ncles, components and materials in order to retain them in various \\nmaterial cycles as a source of secondary raw material. Together \\nwith its national sales companies and importers, the BMW Group \\nhas already organised the return of end -of-life vehicles in 32 \\ncountries and offers environmentally friendly recycling at more \\nthan 2,800 points of return. \\n↗ GRI Index: 301-1, 301-3, ↗ SASB Index \\nCompared to primary raw materials, the use of secondary mate-\\nrials also helps reduce carbon emissions – by up to 80% for al-\\numinium and up to 70% for steel to name two examples.\\u200a At the \\nsame time, potential risks associated with the extraction of pri-\\nmary materials, such as high levels of energy consumption and \\ntherefore carbon emissions, long transportation routes, environ-\\nmental damage and risks arising due to a lack of social standards \\nare being mitigated. As a result, the increased use of secondary \\nmaterials also promotes resilience throughout the value chain. \\n↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network \\nInvestments in resource-friendly technologies  \\nVia the ↗ BMW i Ventures venture capital fund, the BMW  Group in-\\nvests in fast-growing technology start-ups. One focus of the in-\\nvestment activity is on businesses that can make a strong con-\\ntribution to achieving carbon neutrality and conserving re-\\nsources. One example is the Swiss company Bcomp, which the \\nBMW Group has held a share in since 2022. Bcomp uses flax to \\ncreate structural components made from natural fibre compo-\\nsites as an alternative to plastic composites. By increasing our \\nstake in the US start-up Boston Metal in April 2023, we are scal-\\ning up our investment in innovative processes for the manufac-\\nture of carbon-reduced steel. In April 2023, BMW i Ventures also \\nacquired a stake in Cyclic Materials, a company developing a re-\\ncycling technology that extracts rare earths and base metals \\nfrom end-of-life products. \\nThe BMW Group is also investing in research and innovation pro-\\njects such as Circular Republic to implement closed material  \\ncycles for certain product groups. The joint initiative of the organ-\\nisation “UnternehmerTUM” and the BMW Group focuses on the \\ntransfer of knowledge between the world of science and compa-\\nnies to promote the circular economy. \\n  \\n[[ From scrap to raw material: the Car2Car funding \\nproject  \\nThe Car2Car project focuses on the recycling of aluminium, steel, glass, \\ncopper and plastic. Together with representatives of the recycling in-\\ndustry, raw materials processors and the scientific community, the \\nBMW Group is leading a project to improve the quality of secondary \\nraw materials obtained from the recycling of end-of-life vehicles. Inno-\\nvative dismantling and automated sorting processes will enable reus-\\nable materials to be extracted to a far greater extent than previously. \\nAs part of the funding pro ject, the BMW Group is providing 433 end -\\nof-life vehicles. In order to cover a representative range, various mod-\\nels out of the Company’s own inventories are being used – from MINI \\nto Rolls-Royce – with combustion engines, plug-in hybrid systems and \\nall-electric drives. ]] '),\n",

Alongside ↗ Carbon Emissions , the other key indicators for \\nmanaging resource efficiency and controlling resource consump-\\ntion within the BMW Group are ↗ energy consumption, ↗ potable water \\nconsumption, the amount of ↗ waste generated and the use of ↗ VOC \\nsolvents. The BMW Group intends to reduce its energy and pota-\\nble water consumption, waste for disposal, and the amount of \\nsolvents used per vehicle produced by 25% in each category by \\n2030 (base year: 2016). \\nA steering committee manages the international environmental \\nprotection network within the BMW Group. Each individual facil-\\nity, area and building is assigned to an internal operator, who, \\nwithin their area, is responsible for the technical systems, the \\nsmooth running of processes and workflows and their environ-\\nmental impacts.1 \\nA certified environmental management system in accordance \\nwith ISO 14001 has been implemented at all BMW  Group pro-\\nduction sites. Moreover, all the Group’s German plants are certi-\\nfied under the EMAS environmental management system. The \\nBMW Group coordinates its worldwide environmental protection \\nmeasures relating to imissions, water, waste, qualification stand-\\nards, environmental management system in a total of five cen-\\ntralised competence centres. Environmental improvements that \\nhave proven effective at one location are then implemented at \\nother locations to the extent possible. Regular further training \\ncourses and the exchange of experiences within the workforce \\nensure that relevant knowledge is effectively applied throughout \\nthe organisation. During the year under report, our proactive en-\\nvironmental management system again made a major contribu-\\ntion to ensuring that there were no significant environmental in-\\ncidents involving the payment of fines throughout the global pro-\\nduction network. \\nWater \\nThe BMW  Group also aims to continuously reduce water con-\\nsumption at its production plants in order to prevent potential \\nwater supply risks. With this point in mind, wastewater from the \\npaint shops and washing facilities at the assembly plants is re-\\ncycled. Moreover, slightly contaminated water (so- called “grey \\nwater”) is used as process water at the BMW  Group’s Dadong \\nvehicle plant (Shenyang, China). In regions where water is \\nscarce, the BMW Group ensures that it is used as sparingly as \\npossible. At the BMW manufacturing plant in Chennai, India, for \\nexample, rainwater is collected during the monsoon season that \\ncovers up to 100% of its water demand. vAt 1.78 m3 per vehicle \\nproduced, ↗ specific potable water consumption 2,3 in automobile pro-\\nduction was moderately below the previous year’s level due to \\nthe higher production volume (2022: 1.90 m3/-6.3%). ↗ Water \\nconsumption in detail \\nWaste \\nTo minimise the total volume of waste generated, the \\nBMW Group utilises coordinated recycling and processing con-\\ncepts that are adapted to the specific waste streams at its vari-\\nous plants, regionally applicable statutory regulations and local \\nwaste management structures. In 2023, a total of 99.4% 4 \\n(2022: 99.3%) of the waste generated by production was either \\nrecycled or recovered. The amount of ↗ waste for disposal per vehicle \\nproduced5 in the automobile production fell significantly by 22.6% \\nyear on year to 2.12  kg (2022: 2.74 kg).

Due to the progress made in the use of solvent-free \\nsubstances and the constant optimisation of painting processes, \\nwe expect to see a further slight decrease in emissions levels in \\nthe coming year. ↗ GRI Index: 305-7 \\nBiodiversity \\nThe BMW Group also takes biodiversity into account at its vari-\\nous locations worldwide. It assesses biodiversity in the context of \\nits plants, using a biodiversity indicator as an example within the \\nframework of ecological verification procedures. Based on this \\nassessment, measures to improve these habitats are then pro-\\nposed accordingly. We are also committed to protecting \\nbiodiversity in countries where our renewable raw materials are \\ngrown. In Indonesia, for instance, we therefore support local na-\\nture conservation initiatives that are dedicated to preserving nat-\\nural biodiversity via the “Living Rubber” project.

The latter resulted in \\nhigher costs for the BMW Group, primarily for raw materials, \\nsemiconductors, energy and transportation. The overall supply \\nsituation also remained challenging in 2023. The supply situa-\\ntion for semiconductors in particular will remain challenging for \\ncertain technologies in the current financial year. \\n↗ Outlook, ↗ Risks \\nand Opportunities \\nNatural disasters pose an additional risk. Extensive flooding in \\nSlovenia led to delivery difficulties during the year under report. \\nThe prospect of climate change and the increasing number of \\nextreme weather events are likely to make planning more difficult \\ngoing forward. However, the BMW Group is able to mitigate the \\neffects of these unexpected events through its flexible supply \\nnetwork and thus largely ensure its ability to deliver vehicles. \\nTo lessen the impact of the war in Ukraine on its European \\nplants, since 2022 extensive measures have been in place, and \\ntherefore continues to source components from western Ukraine. \\nAt the same time, our partners have established additional pro-\\nduction sites outside Ukraine. As a result of these various \\nmeasures the supply of wiring harnesses to our plants has \\nlargely returned to normal. The situation is, however, being mon-\\nitored continually.  \\nExpanding resilient supply chains  \\nDuring the year under report, the BMW Group was generally able \\nto rely on the stability of its supply chains, despite the problems \\ncaused by geopolitical crises and the availability of critical raw \\nmaterials. Price increases on global markets also tended to in-\\ntensify the tense purchasing situation. The BMW Group RiskHub \\nplays a key role in making our global supply chains more resilient. \\nFor example, it helps to identify risks at an earlier stage through \\nthe use of artificial intelligence (AI). We see the development of \\nthe Catena-X digital ecosystem as the key to standardised data \\ntransfers throughout our supplier network. \\nThe BMW Group follows the principle of procuring vehicle com-\\nponents close to its production sites, wherever possible. We are \\ntherefore represented by local purchasing teams in all key mar-\\nkets in order to quickly identify local risks and opportunities and \\nrespond flexibly to the respective market conditions. In the face \\nof geostrategic aspects, a resilient strategy for the Group’s sup-\\nply chains is also becoming increasingly important and the \\nBMW Group takes this fact increasingly into account when se-\\nlecting its partners. \\nRegional distribution of the BMW Group’s purchased  \\nvolumes* \\nin % \\n*Direct and indirect purchasing. \\nRisk management in purchasing \\nAn interconnected risk management system is fundamental for \\nmanaging the supplier network. It takes preventative action when \\nnominating suppliers, while also reacting quickly in order to iden-\\ntify and analyse impending supply bottlenecks. The \\nBMW Group’s RiskHub analyses information from external, pub-\\nlic-ly available data sources with regard to potential risks such as \\nnatural disasters or financial risks. We also employ state-of-the-\\nart methods derived from the fields of AI and big data analytics. \\nFor selected topics such as the reliable supply of semiconductor \\ncomponents, we also take the locations of sub-suppliers into ac-\\ncount when assessing overall risk. \\nIn order to avoid cyber risks and deal effectively with an increas-\\ning number of supplier-related incidents, the BMW Group contin-\\nues to rely on supplier certification in accordance with the TISAX \\nautomotive standard. When it comes to purchasing materials \\nboth directly and indirectly, TISAX is an integral part of the pro-\\ncurement process and an inherent component of contracts with \\nsuppliers that meet the specific relevance criteria.

The long-\\nterm supply of critical raw materials required for electric mobility \\nremains a strategic challenge. Measures taken by the \\nBMW Group to increase supply security and promote the pro-\\ncurement of raw materials from responsible sources include, \\namong other things, sourcing lithium and cobalt directly. Further-\\nmore, the BMW Group analyses the development of raw materi-\\nals prices and hedges against price fluctuations – provided the \\ncapital market offers the opportunity to do so. ↗ Raw materials price \\nrisks and opportunities \\nFor the BMW Group, the responsible procurement of raw mate-\\nrials is the result of a holistic approach that takes economic, eco-\\nlogical and social aspects equally into account. Our commitment \\nto upholding environmental and social standards as well as hu-\\nman rights throughout our raw materials supply chains is set out \\nin, among other places, the ↗ BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct  in \\nwhich we oblige our Tier 1 suppliers to pass on our requirements \\nto their upstream sub-suppliers. There are also raw -materials-\\nspecific statements such as the ↗ High Level Commitment for \\nsustainable natural rubber. \\nAnnual risk analyses form the basis for implementing raw-mate-\\nrials-related preventive and remedial measures to reduce envi-\\nronmental and human rights risks. Key levers in this respect are \\nto forgo, substitute or reduce the use of primary raw materials \\nthat entail a high level of risk. The BMW Group’s secondary raw \\nmaterials strategy is of vital significance in this context: ↗ Circular \\neconomy, resource efficiency and renewable energy. We also focus in par-\\nticular on collaborating closely with our partners in the supplier \\nnetwork as well as in multistakeholder initiatives and projects. \\nWe use scientific findings to gain an even better understanding \\nof the extraction processes of raw materials and take them into \\naccount accordingly when analysing the level of risk. ↗ Lithium \\nStudy \\nAmong other things, the BMW Group focuses on the conflict min-\\nerals tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG) and uses standard-\\nised tools of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) to trace raw \\nmaterials back to the smelter. We use existing certifications for \\nother raw materials. The BMW Group is also involved in develop-\\ning certified standards for critical stages of the value chain, for \\nexample as part of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assur-\\nance (IRMA), and is engaged in their implementation by suppli-\\ners. Further details and raw materials profiles are available \\n↗ online. ↗ SASB Index \\nMoreover, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of generating a \\npositive impact for selected raw materials through our involve-\\nment in local development projects. This currently applies to the \\nraw materials lithium, mica, cobalt and natural rubber. \\nPurchasing battery cells  \\nAs of 2025, the BMW Group plans to deploy a new generation of \\nbattery cells. Against this backdrop, we have concluded contracts \\nwith our partners that guarantee us annual production capacities \\nin Europe, China and the USA. We are strategically establishing \\nsupply chains for battery cells close to our production sites, \\nthereby underpinning the “local for local” approach. During the \\nyear under report, we entered into a new partnership in North \\nAmerica to make the battery cell supply chain more resilient. \\nTo strengthen this resilience even further, we plan to anchor the \\nupstream value chain for critical components in the respective re-\\ngions while accounting for geopolitical risks and economic effi-\\nciency. Through this, the BMW Group also aims to improve its \\nresilience in the face of external events while redu cing its de-\\npendence on geopolitical factors and its exposure to related \\nrisks. \\nSecondary raw materials will be increasingly deployed to cover \\nthe BMW Group’s cobalt, lithium and nickel requirements, to-\\ngether with purchased green electricity for the latest generation \\nof battery cells. Contracts and framework agreements have al-\\nready been concluded with suppliers to this end. This will help \\nfurther reduce our carbon footprint from the new battery cell in \\nthe supply chain compared to the previous generation. ↗ Carbon \\nemissions in the supply chain \\nIn-house production as a strategic competitive advantage \\nThe BMW Group regularly examines its range of products in \\nterms of their profitability and strategic significance. The main fo-\\ncus is being directed at electric mobility, digitalisation and sus-\\ntainability. In these key areas of transformation, the BMW Group \\nis expanding its in-house expertise on a targeted and long-term \\nbasis on matters relating to strategically important components. \\nAt the same time, in-house production aims to improve both se-\\ncurity of supply and the ability to innovate. The benefits of this \\napproach have already been seen, for example, with the control \\nunit of the high-voltage storage system and scopes of the electric \\ndrive equipment. At the same time, we are looking to strengthen \\nour process competencies in technologies relevant for quality \\nmanagement and enablement within the supplier network. \\nQuality assurance \\nQuality is a promise we make to our customers as well as a de-\\ncisive competitive advantage and an essential factor for the en-\\nduring success of the BMW Group. The quality management sys-\\ntem is the basis for continuously improving the quality of our \\nproducts, processes and services. It consists of an intercon-\\nnected, comprehensive system that encompasses the entire \\nproduct development process, industrialisation and series pro-\\nduction with respect to both in-house production and the supplier \\nnetwork. The various steps are supported based on need by our \\nteams of quality experts when necessary. The ultimate aim is to \\nensure – both preventatively and systematically – that all quality \\nrequirements are met at all times. \\nInnovations \\nCollaboration with technology partners and the establishment of \\nnew networks enables us to implement innovations in our vehi-\\ncles within a very short time. In this context, we work closely with \\nthe ↗ BMW Startup Garage and ↗ BMW i Ventures.  \\nThe specialist teams cooperate in technology clusters to sharpen \\nthe focus on innovation screening, which is implemented through \\nstrategic supplier dialogue formats (Future Vision DeepDive) and \\nother means. Findings from the supplier network are systemati-\\ncally processed within the technology clusters. '),\n",

The digital platform enables par tners \\nwithin value chains to tackle key challenges facing the industry, \\nsuch as enhancing resilience, meeting sustainability goals and \\nregulatory matters through digital collaboration. After two years \\nof development work, including a significant contribution from the \\nBMW Group as consortium leader, a beta test phase was suc-\\ncessfully conducted in 2023. Among other things, pilot projects \\nwere carried out in conjunction with BMW component produc-\\ntion, providing valuable insights that will serve to promote inno-\\nvative data processing methods in a production environment. \\nCatena-X has been in the rollout phase since October 2023.  \\nThe BMW  Group is focusing mainly on component traceability \\nalong multistage supply chains, cooperative root cause analysis \\nto combat any potential quality problems and the collection of \\ncarbon-emissions-related data in the supply chains. In 2024, ef-\\nforts will be scaled up with suppliers with the aim of further im-\\nplementing and developing additional “use cases” as well as \\nscaling these for strategic relevant components through the in-\\ndustry network. Another key advancement is the provision of dig-\\nital product passports, which contain product-specific data for \\ncomponents such as batteries or even for entire vehicles. Based \\non information from th e n-tier supply chain via Catena -X, data \\nare available in particular regarding origin, material composition \\nand recycling. \\nSocial and environmental responsibility \\nThe BMW Group views responsible supply chain management \\nas an integral part of good corporat e governance The develop-\\nment of established processes was continued throughout the \\nyear under report. The BMW Group’s requirements and the ex-\\npectations it places on its suppliers are set out in the ↗ BMW Group \\nSupplier Code of Conduct  and contractually enshrined as an integral \\npart of the BMW  Group’s Terms and Conditions of Purchase. \\n↗ GRI Index: 2-23, 3-3, 407-1, 408-1 \\nThe BMW  Group’s overarching approach to respecting human \\nrights and upholding social standards along the entire value \\nchain is provided in the chapter on ↗ Compliance and Human Rights. \\nDue diligence in the supplier network  \\nOur corporate responsibility for environmental and social stand-\\nards in the supply chain is institutionalised as part of a multi-\\nstage due diligence process. We mainly use standardised control \\nprocedures to carry out the due diligence obligations incorpo-\\nrated in our business processes. The BMW  Group also cooper-\\nates with initiatives and associations such as the Responsible \\nBusiness Alliance (RBA) and Drive Sustainability. In this context, \\nwe follow the guidelines developed by the German Automotive \\nIndustry Dialogue. We also remain committed to establishing an \\nindustry-wide complaints mechanism, among other things. \\n― Risk analysis  \\nThe BMW Group monitors and assesses the sustainability risks \\nin its supplier network in business relationships at both potential \\nand active supplier locations. In order to identify and assess ab-\\nstract environmental and human rights risks, various internal and \\nexternal data sources such as country- and product-group-spe-\\ncific indicators as well as media analyses at Group and location \\nlevel are drawn upon. The BMW Group uses standardised sus-\\ntainability surveys and commissions external on-site audits (as-\\nsessments) to conduct in-depth risk analyses for its Tier 1 sup-\\npliers. Supply chain mapping forms the basis for analysing risks \\nat n-Tier suppliers. The BMW Group continuously endeavours to \\nincrease transparency along the entire supply chain. ↗ GRI Index: \\n2-24, 308-1, 414-1 \\n― Prevention and remediation \\nPrior to signing a contract with the BMW  Group, if any risks are \\nidentified in the course of the specific risk analysis, our suppliers \\nare required to implement or expand the necessary preventive or \\nremediation and control measures by an agreed target date. Our \\nsuppliers are also required to request these from their subcon-\\ntractors based on their respective risks. The measures, which are \\nqueried, validated and evaluated as part of the sourcing process \\nusing the industry-wide questionnaire from ↗ Drive Sustainability , \\nserve to minimise potential risks or eliminate existing deficien-\\ncies. ↗ Further GRI  information, ↗ Sustainability assessment of relevant \\nsupplier locations This online assessment is performed for suppliers \\nof production-related goods and services with a contract volume \\nover a certain threshold. Different modules are used depending \\non the size of the company being assessed. Implementation \\nmust be successfully completed prior to the start of production. \\nFor suppliers of non-production-related goods and services, this \\nprocedure is also carried out depending on country- and product-\\ngroup-specific risks. The extent of the preventive measures is \\nbased on the potential risks, the nature and scope of the busi-\\nness activity and the size of the supplier. In addition, we offer \\ntraining courses on sustainability in the supply chain, some of \\nwhich are mandatory for internal purchasers. These trainings \\nalso address process partners and suppliers on a voluntary ba-\\nsis. \\nThe BMW Group has put additional control mechanisms in place \\nfor suppliers in high-risk regions or high-risk product groups. Key \\ninstruments in this respect are audits of environmental and social \\nstandards at supplier locations using cross-industry assessment \\nprogrammes provided by the Responsible Business Alliance \\n(RBA) and the Responsible Supply Chain Initiative (RSCI) of the \\nVDA. The BMW Group reviewed a total of 95 potential and active \\nsupplier locations using this method during the reporting year \\n(2022: 49). The BMW Group has set itself the goal that all Tier 1 \\nsupplier sites that have been assessed meet the locally applica-\\nble statutory requirements for sustainability as well as interna-\\ntional human rights standards (BMW Group minimum require-\\nments).

In two cases, the closure as-\\nsessment carried out was  not immediately able to confirm that \\nthe agreed measures had been implemented. However, together \\nwith the suppliers the BMW Group has now implemented these \\nmeasures, which will be reviewed by means of a new assess-\\nment in 2024. ↗ GRI Index: 2-24, 308-2, 414-2 \\n― Effectiveness and complaint mechanisms \\nInformation on possible violations of the BMW Group’s sustaina-\\nbility requirements in the supplier network can be submitted via \\nthe BMW Group Human Rights Contact Supply Chain, among \\nother options. We also use the standardised RBA Voices com-\\nplaint mechanism as a complementary measure. Moreover, \\nwhistle-blower systems are in place to detect and report possible \\nstatutory violations. Our aim is to ensure that all substantiated \\nreports of environmental or human rights violations are rectified \\nby agreeing on remediation measures. Further information on \\nwhistle-blower systems at the BMW  Group can be found in the \\nchapter ↗ Compliance and Human Rights and on the ↗ website. \\nIf necessary, the BMW Group temporarily suspends a given busi-\\nness relationship during efforts to mitigate the detected risk. \\nHowever, the business relationship will only be terminated if no \\nother effective means are available and we are unable to further \\nleverage our ability to exert influence. We endeavour to avoid this \\nlatter situation by carefully selecting our suppliers and empower-\\ning and working with them to improve their sustainability perfor-\\nmance. No existing supplier relationships needed to be termi-\\nnated due to serious sustainability violations during the year un-\\nder report. ↗ GRI Index: 2-24, 3-3, 308-1, 414-1 \\nCarbon emissions in the supply chain \\nThe BMW Group aims to actively promote decarbonisation in its \\nown supply chain and ↗ reduce carbon emissions along the entire value \\nchain. For this re ason, one of our sourcing criteria requires that \\nsuppliers commit to undertaking decarbonisation measures.\\u200a1 We \\nspecifically enable our suppliers with online training via the \\nBMW Group Partner Academy and additionally provide face -to-\\nface formats for partner workshops at the BMW  Group plant in \\nLandshut (Germany) as well as other locations. ↗ GRI Index: 3-3 \\nIn 2023, the number of contractual agreements with suppliers \\nthat specified decarbonisation measures rose to 707 (2022: \\n468), Including those specifying the use of secondary raw mate-\\nrials, biomaterials and carbon-reduced steel. In our view, how-\\never, the use of green electricity has the greatest impact on de-\\ncarbonising the supply chain2. Accordin gly, the BMW  Group \\nspecifies its use by direct suppliers (Tier 1) and for energy-inten-\\nsive processes in the upstream supply chain (n -Tier) as a crite-\\nrion for awarding new contracts to supply carbon-intensive com-\\nponents and materials. During the year under report, we con-\\ncluded agreements of this kind for 676 contracts (2022: 343 \\ncontracts). In addition, since mid-2021 the BMW Group has con-\\ncluded numerous framework agreements with suppliers regard-\\ning the use of green electricity.2 In 2023, the BMW Group had 72 \\nvalid green electricity framework agreements in place with its \\nlargest suppliers (2022: 46). During the year under report, we \\ndeveloped an approach to review suppliers’ concepts for the use \\nof green electricity even prior to series production. \\nFurthermore, we continue to engage an external service provider \\nto carry out annual reviews relating to decarbonisation measures \\nin series production. In the course of 2023, the BMW  Group re-\\nviewed compliance with contractually agreed decarbonisation \\nmeasures in the supply chain at 72 suppliers (2022: 23). As a \\nresult, the BMW Group reduced the volume of carbon emissions \\ngenerated in the supply chain by around 1.7 million t CO2e during \\nthe reporting period. In 2023, carbon emissions generated in the \\nsupply chain and via logistics on behalf of the BMW Group world-\\nwide averaged 13.9 t CO2e per vehicle produced (t CO2e)3. As ex-\\npected, the gradual electrification of the fleet leads to a rise in \\nemissions generated in the supply chain. We assume that the \\ncurrent upward trend will reverse by 2026 at the latest thanks to \\nthe implementation of carbon-reducing measures. \\nWe continue to rely on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Sup-\\nply Chain Programme to assess the performance of the supply \\nchain in terms of its decarbonisation. This helps suppliers to de-\\nfine their decarbonisation targets, integrate these into their busi-\\nness processes and report on the actual reductions achieved. \\nTheir efforts are linked to a rating from which we derive measures \\nfor supplier development and empowerment. In 2023, 282 sup-\\npliers took part in the rating (84% of the production-relevant pur-\\nchasing volume). \\n1 The BMW Group includes measures that reduce carbon emissions, such as the use of green elec-\\ntricity, the use of secondary raw materials, new manufacturing processes for raw materials, and \\nproduct and material innovations such as biomaterials. Accordingly, compensation measures are \\nnot included. \\n2 In-house generation, direct purchase or Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g. guarantees of origin). \\n3 The procedure for determining the key figures is explained in the glossary.

The digital safety and ergonomic \\nrisk analysis (SERA) records threats and sources of stress for \\nproduction workplaces and production-related areas worldwide. \\nThe SERA takes into account the stricter US regulations and re-\\nquirements in addition to the German legal regulations. In pro-\\nduction, the use of laser scanners for presence monitoring in \\nsmall robot cells serves as another example of increased safety \\nmeasures. \\nThe use of management systems and certifications (e.g. Occu-\\npational Health and Safety Assessment Series, OHSAS 18001) \\nis aimed at continuously developing internal guidelines for occu-\\npational safety and the ergonomic design of the workplace. \\nResponsibility for the topics of health and occupational safety is \\nenshrined in the Work Environment, Group Safety and Group \\nData Protection division. ↗ GRI Index: 403-1 \\nHealth management on a holistic basis \\nThe BMW Group bundles all measures to maintain health and \\nperformance in the “Health Initiative”. In the reporting year, the \\nfocus of health management was on psychological and mental \\nhealth. We discussed various mental health topics in expert pan-\\nels in the new “Health Talks” format. Our “Health and Leader-\\nship” programme also focuses on managers’ responsibility for \\nthe mental health of our employees. \\nWe use regular action days, dialogue events and training courses \\nto inform our employees and raise awareness of current health-\\nrelated topics such as nutrition, exercise and fitness, behavioural \\nergonomics and cancer prevention. \\nTo help promote a ba lanced diet, BMW AG runs company can-\\nteens in Germany. We focus on regional and sustainably pro-\\nduced food. The sustainability criteria used in supplier audits in-\\nclude sustainable water management during production, the use \\nof renewable energy and compliance with product -group-spe-\\ncific regulations. Since 2023, the “Sustainable Catering” guide-\\nlines have also been in place at most international locations, \\naimed at further improving the environmental impact of BMW’s \\ncatering services. \\nIt is important to the BMW Group that all employees have access \\nto the Company’s own health services. In Germany, these ser-\\nvices focus on providing acute care to employees and temporary \\nemployees during working times. At some locations – such as \\nSouth Africa, Thailand, India and Mex ico – health management \\nalso involves the provision of basic healthcare. The \\nBMW Group’s occupational physicians advise employees on in-\\ndividual preventive measures on request. They also help to or-\\nganise the respective working environment in such a way that \\nhealth and performance can be maintained over the long term. \\nThe provision of occupational healthcare and medical advice \\nhelps to prevent work-related health problems at an early stage \\nand avoid accidents at work. ↗ GRI Index: 3-3, 401-2, 403-3, 403-6 \\nOne of the ways in which the Company measures the success of \\nhealth management is by its sickness rate, which at 3.8% at \\nBMW AG was below the previous year (2022: 4.2%). The \\nsickness rate in Germany remained at a high level until the mid-\\ndle of 2023 and normalised over the course of the year. \\nNevertheless, we aim to reduce this level, for example, with tar-\\ngeted measures in accordance with our “Attendance Manage-\\nment Works Agreement” (BAM) and the relevant health manage-\\nment initiatives. BAM is a service provided by the BMW Group to \\npromote the health of employees and increase their attendance. \\nHealth-preserving and health -promoting measures and offers \\nfrom the Company are also suggested to employees. The dis-\\ncussions are conducted by managers regularly or as needed. \\n↗ GRI Index: 403-10 \\nSickness rate BMW AG*  \\nin % \\n \\n \\n* Number of hours of absence due to paid sick leave divided by the contractually agreed number of \\nworking hours. \\n3.7\\n3.4 3.4\\n4.2\\n3.8\\n2.0\\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023'),\n",

The seminar curriculum is \\ndrawn up in collaboration with safety specialists, Company doc-\\ntors and the BMW Group Academy. \\nCertified occupational health and safety management \\nsystem \\nThe BMW  Group follows the globally recognised ISO 45001 \\nstandard for occupational health and safety. Occupational health \\nand safety management systems are in place at all production \\nsites, and 29 of the 32 plants are certified in accordance with this \\nstandard or OHRIS1, which is based on ISO 45001. This means \\nthat 99.80%2 (2022: 99.79 %) of employees and 100% (2022: \\n99.98%) of temporary employees at BMW Group plants work at \\na site covered by an international occupational health and safety \\nmanagement system. The BMW Group plant in Manaus (Brazil, \\ncertification planned for 2024), the contract manufacturing facil-\\nities in Born (the Netherlands, production will end in 2024) and \\nthe jointly managed Spotlight plant in Zhangjiagang (certification \\nplanned for 2024) are not currently certified. \\nThe BMW Group has set the goal of obtaining certification to one \\nof the aforementioned international standards for all of its plants \\nby 2025. Employer and employee representatives work together \\nat nearly all locations to bring about a continual improvement in \\nhealth and safety standards. ↗ GRI Index: 403-1, 403-4, 403-8 \\nRecognising and avoiding risks \\nThe BMW Group conducts comprehensive risk and stress ana -\\nlyses in order to identify potential work-related risks in both pro-\\nduction and office workplaces. With the Digital Workplace Stress \\nManagement (DWSM) project – a fully automated ergonomics \\nassessment – the BMW Group continues to set standards in the \\nautomotive industry. Over the last two years, ergonomics spe-\\ncialists from the BMW Group have been training employees in \\nthe use of DWSM at all assembly locations in Germany. Prepa-\\nrations have also been made at the locations in Mexico, the UK, \\nthe USA and South Africa for the implementation of DWSM.  \\nThe BMW  Group regularly assesses all methods and instru-\\nments used within the Company. The results of the assessments \\nare subsequently used to enhance internal norms. The Works \\nCouncil and, if necessary, the representatives of severely disa-\\nbled employees and HR management are involved. \\nThe BMW Group ensures the quality of its processes by means \\nof annual internal audits. Audits and certifications of sites are \\nconducted by external service providers. All necessary audits \\nwere again successfully performed in 2023. The results and re-\\nsulting measures are made available to all BMW Group locations. \\n↗ GRI Index: 403-2, 403-7 \\nAccident frequency at a low level \\nThe BMW Group’s preventive measures continue to have an im-\\npact. In 2023, these also meant that the accident frequency rate \\nremained at a low level of 2.0 (2022: 1.93).

Key princi-\\nples such as protection against discrimination, equal treatment \\nof all employees and respect at all times are firmly embedded in \\nthe \\n↗ BMW Group Code of Conduct  and the ↗ BMW Group Code of Human \\nRights and Working Conditions. \\nEqual opportunities at the BMW Group are also expressed in a \\nremuneration system that is designed to be independent of gen-\\nder, religious denomination, origin, age, disability, sexual orien-\\ntation or country-specific characteristics. In the reporting year, \\nBMW AG was the first German company to be certified as a Fair \\nPay Leader by the Fair Pay Innovation Lab (FPI). The certifica-\\ntion is evidence that BMW AG’s remuneration structures are ef-\\nfective in ensuring equal salaries between women and men. This \\nis supported by annual, science-based equal pay analyses, a \\npractice which the BMW Group also aims to expand to interna-\\ntional locations in the future. \\n↗ GRI Index: 405-2 \\nAll employees can contact their managers, the relevant specialist \\ndepartments, the HR department, the Works council and the rep-\\nresentative body for employees with disabilities with concerns \\nrelating to diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion.

From \\n2024, all BMW Group employees will be offered anti-discrimina-\\ntion training. We have also introduced measures such as the \\n↗ Senior Expert Programme  and the Joint Leadership Programme, \\nwhich were used with increasing frequency in 2023. The BMW \\nGroup also commissioned an external analysis of its existing \\ncommitments, with a focus on the dimensions of sexual orienta-\\ntion and identity. This took place within the framework of our \\nmembership with “PROUT AT WORK”, a leading foundation and \\nconsultancy in Germany focusi ng on LGBTIQ+3 issues in the \\nworkplace, aimed at promoting equality for individuals within the \\nqueer community. We will use this as the basis for specific \\nmeasures in the next step. \\nThe established “Diversity Week” was expanded in 2023 to be-\\ncome the international “Days of Diversity” for the first time. \\nThroughout the year, numerous activities – such as lectures, \\nworkshops and interactive events for employees – took place at \\nour locations worldwide, including special events on International \\nWomen’s Day and the International Days of Cultural Diversity \\nand Tolerance. In the reporting year, we also implemented \\nmeasures that were adopted in 2022 as part of the revised ver-\\nsion of BMW AG’s general operating and inclusion agreement for \\nemployees with disabilities. Examples of this include our require-\\nments for barrier-free access in the areas of Manufacture and IT. \\nAs in previous years, BMW  AG in Germany awarded contracts \\namounting to around €  42.7 million (2022: € 41.1 million) in \\n2023 to workshops staffed by people with disabilities. \\n1 Direct: Clock-controlled and production employees. \\n2 Indirect: All employees not engaged in clock-controlled work. \\n3 Abbreviation for all sexual orientations and forms of identity.

As such, we not only live up to our own aspirations but \\nalso the expectations of society and our stakeholders worldwide. \\nThe BMW Group aims to act in a targeted, long -term and effec-\\ntive manner. We also provide quick and unbureaucratic assis-\\ntance in the event of a crisis. We have defined four key topics that \\nare reflected in our projects on the basis of our core business and \\nskill sets: \\n― Inclusion for equal opportunities \\nThe BMW Group is a partner of the ↗ Intercultural Innovation Hub (IIH). \\nThis platform has emerged from our long- standing partnership \\nwith the UN Alliance of Civilizations and supports selected organ-\\nisations around the world that are engaged in concrete projects \\npromoting intercultural dialogue, peace and diversity, among \\nother initiatives. For this purpose, they receive support for over a \\nyear in the form of expertise, networking opportunities and finan-\\ncial resources. The ↗ currently funded projects were honoured at an \\nevent in Berlin in May 2023. \\nWe also contribute, for example, by supporting the ↗ JOBLINGE \\nprogramme. The initiative helps people with a difficult start in life \\nto begin their professional lives. \\n― Responsible Leadership for sustainable development \\nThe BMW  Group wants to support and bring together people \\nwho are committed to societal needs. The annual One Young \\nWorld Summit represents an international networking oppor-\\ntunity. The BMW Group has been sending a delegation of young \\nmanagers to the global forum for sustainable development since \\n2016, including in 2023. Selected IIH organisations also had the \\nopportunity to take part in the international event. \\nTo support young talent, the BMW Group awards full-time schol-\\narships for the Global Online Master in Business Administration \\n(MBA) at the ↗ European School of Management and Technology (ESMT) \\nBerlin as part of the ↗ BMW Group Change Maker Fellowships. In addition, \\nthe ↗ BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt expands our network with more \\nthan 2,300 Responsible Leaders from over 100 countries on all \\ncontinents. As an important partner, the independent corporate \\nfoundation contributes with its activities to the perception of so-\\ncial responsibility at the BMW Group. \\n― Education for future generations \\nThe BMW Group has been supporting educational projects at its \\nlocations worldwide for many years. With ↗ BRIDGE. We are taking the \\nnext step with Educating young people for tomorrow, today  – a global and \\nlong-term collaboration with UNICEF that started in 2023. The \\ncollaboration aims to qualify young people in Brazil, China, India, \\nMexico and South Africa for careers in the mathematical and \\ntechnical fields, while also collecting donations for the education \\nof children and adolescents in crisis areas within existing plat-\\nforms, and with the involvement of international subsidiaries and \\nstakeholders. The BMW Group is thereby making a long-term \\ncontribution to UNICEF’s goal of reaching more than ten million \\nchildren and adolescents through education. By undertaking this \\ncommitment, we are simultaneously implementing our corporate \\ncitizenship strategy at the local level, for example, through men-\\ntoring and internship opportunities directly at our locations. \\n― Culture and Sports for a united world  \\nThe BMW Group supports numerous sports and cultural activi-\\nties worldwide. For example, the “Opera for All” initiative pro-\\nvides free access to opera and classical music in Munich, Berlin, \\nMelbourne and London. In the context of our sports sponsor-\\nships, we also contribute, for example, through the scholarship \\nprogramme of the ↗ Evans Scholars Foundation  in conjunction with \\nthe BMW Championships golf tournament. \\nValuing and supporting employee commitment \\nThe\\n BMW Group promotes and encourages empl oyees to sup-\\nport social issues around the world in various ways through its \\nSOCIAL DRIVE initiative. The first pillar is the annual BMW Group \\nAWARD for social commitment, which has recognised the out-\\nstanding commitment of individual employees for 12 years. Of \\nthe ten finalists in 2023, four emerged as winners – one of whom \\nalso won the special Doppelfeld Foundation prize. The prize \\nmoney of € 10,000 each will be used to fund the relevant charity \\nprojects. The second pillar is the SOCIAL DRIVE IT platform, \\nwhich informs employees about specific support needs. The \\nplatform launched in Germany in 2022 and is currently being \\nrolled out internationally. With our employees’ help, we can also \\nprovide more comprehensive support for existing projects, for ex-\\nample through volunteer work and monetary donations. The \\nthird pillar is the SOCIAL DRIVE DAYS, which are intended to \\nstrengthen our employees’ interest in social commitment. \\nCorporate citizenship with impact \\nThe BMW Group’s expenditure within the strategic focus areas \\nin 2023 totalled € 44.2 million (2022: € 38.7 million). This in-\\ncludes donations for those affected by earthquakes in Turkey, \\nSyria and China, as well as fires in Hawaii and the floods in Italy. \\nBeyond financial support, the BMW  Group also provides assis-\\ntance in the form of knowledge transfer, networking opportuni-\\nties, projects to promote public infrastructure, and the engage-\\nment of its own workforce. We also generate additional societal \\nimpact through memberships in associations and institutions, \\nthe provision of vehicles, including for vocational schools, and \\nparticipation in projects aimed at promoting more sustainable \\nmobility in cities. ↗ Shaping the future of mobility  In doing so, we aim \\nto contribute as corporate citizens and play our part in address-\\ning major future questions and challenges. ]] '),\n",

In line with the \\nGroup’s performance management, the outlook covers a period \\nof one year. Short-term risks and opportunities are managed on \\nthe basis of a two-year assessment period. In addition, we report \\non medium- and long-term risks and opportunities arising in con-\\nnection with climate change. \\nThe continuous forecasting process applied within the \\nBMW Group ensures that it is constantly ready to take advantage \\nof opportunities as they arise, but also to react appropriately to \\nany unexpected risks. The principal ↗ Risks and Opportunities are de-\\nscribed in detail in the section of the same name and concern all \\nperformance indicators. Actual outcomes may, however, deviate \\nfrom the outlook due to unexpected events. \\nEconomic outlook \\nThe International Monetary Fund anticipates global growth of \\n3.1% in 2024.  Geopolitical conflicts and the effects of tighter \\nmonetary policy in many countries will be the greatest burdens \\non the global economy in 2024. Higher interest rates are affect-\\ning consumer spending and investment, with a corresponding ef-\\nfect on the economy. Further information on political and global \\neconomic risks is also available in the ↗ Risks and Opportunities sec-\\ntion.  \\nForecasts for the eurozone as a whole indicate slight growth \\n(+0.6%). France (+0.7%), Italy (+0.5%) and Spain (+1.6%) are \\nexpected to meet or outstrip the average for the eurozone. Ger-\\nmany is expected to record at least a slight increase in economic \\noutput in 2024 (+0.3%), although the continued modest growth \\nin the global economy is dampening the country’s export econ-\\nomy. \\nA slight uptick in economic output (+0.4%) is forecast for the UK, \\nwhere higher interest rates and continued higher inflation are \\nslowing growth. \\nThe growth rate in the USA is expected to slow to 1.8% in 2024. \\nHigher interest rates are burdening companies and private \\nhouseholds in that country as well, while continually low unem-\\nployment levels are supporting the economy. \\nGrowth is expected to reach 4.6% in China, where continued up-\\nheaval in the real estate sector and the resulting drop in con-\\nsumer confidence are dampening expectations. \\nThe Japanese economy is expected to see slower growth in \\n2024 than in the previous year (+0.8%). \\nCurrency markets and international interest rate \\nenvironment \\nCurrencies of particular importance for the international opera-\\ntions of the BMW Group are the Chinese renminbi, the British \\npound, the US dollar, the Japanese yen an d the South Korean \\nwon.  \\nIt is expected that inflation in the US and in Europe will continue \\nto fall, and the BMW Group therefore does not expect any further \\ninterest rate hikes from central banks. Accordingly, the US dollar \\nis expected to move sideways against the euro in 2024, with the \\npound/euro exchange rate also expected to remain stable. \\nIt is possible that Japan’s highly expansionary monetary policy \\nmay come to an end in 2024. If it does, the yen would appreciate \\nsomewhat against the euro compared to its current very low \\nlevel.  \\nLow inflation in China could lead to a more expansionary mone-\\ntary policy on the part of the central bank of China, potentially \\nresulting in a depreciation of the renminbi against the euro.  \\nThe currencies of emerging countries such as India and Brazil \\nmay benefit from the monetary policies of the EU and USA sta-\\nbilising in 2024. No further devaluations against the euro and US \\ndollar are therefore expected at present. \\nInternational automobile markets \\nThe generally stable macroeconomic conditions should allow for \\nslight growth on international automobile markets in 2024 \\n(+ 3.9%). Growth is expected to be spread across many mar-\\nkets, particularly the US and China. A higher global supply of new \\nvehicles is, however, expected to give rise to increasing price \\ncompetition, which will also have an effect on prices for pre-\\nowned vehicles. \\nInternational motorcycle markets \\nThe BMW Group expects the world’s motorcycle markets in the \\n500 cc plus class to remain in line with the previous year overall \\nin 2024. In Europe, market growth is also expected to be in line \\nwith last year's level, with a slight decrease forecast in the USA. \\nEconomic expectations will influence the motorcycle market in \\nChina, while the motorcycle market in Brazil is expected to re-\\nmain in a stable condition in 2024, as in the previous year. \\n  \\nOUTLOOK  \"),\n",

As a result, actual outcomes can \\ndeviate either positively or negatively from the expectations de-\\nscribed below due to changes in the political and economic envi-\\nronment as well as other factors. \\nThe following outlook covers a forecast period of one year and is \\nbased on the composition of the BMW  Group during that time. \\nThe outlook takes account of all information available at the time \\nof reporting that could have an impact on the BMW Group’s  \\nperformance. \\nThe expectations contained in the outlook are based on the \\nBMW Group’s forecast for 2024 and reflect its status at the time \\nof preparation of the Group Financial Statements. The basis for \\nthe preparation of and the principal assumptions used in the \\nforecasts – which consider the consensual opinions of leadi ng \\norganisations, such as economic research institutes and banks – \\nare set out below. The BMW  Group’s outlook takes account of \\nthese assumptions. \\nIt is expected that a fall in inflation and stabilised interest rates in \\nmany countries will allow for a slight increase in demand in 2024. \\nThe number of vehicle deliveries is set to increase slightly against \\nthis backdrop and in light of the full availability of new models \\nsuch as the BMW 7 Series and the BMW 5 Series, model \\nlaunches such as the BMW X2 and BMW X3, and the renewal of \\nthe MINI product range. Pricing across the product portfolio is ex-\\npected to remain at prior year’s level. \\nThe BMW Group anticipates an improved situation on the com-\\nmodity markets in 2024 in light of the downward price trend for \\nprecious metals and battery materials in the second half of 2023. \\nThe continued rise in all- electric and electrified vehicle numbers \\ndoes, however, mean that expenditure will remain at a high level. \\nHigher costs for employees are expected in 2024, along with \\nhigher costs from the supply chain, owing to high inflation in pre-\\nvious years.  \\nIn addition, the continued implementation of the electrification \\nand digitalisation strategy will lead to greater research and de-\\nvelopment costs in 2024. Expenditure related to the NEUE \\nKLASSE, such as the further development of the sixth generation \\nof battery technology and manufacturing preparations in the pro-\\nduction network, will also impact the Group’s earnings and result \\nin greater capital expenditure.  \\nThe situation in the Mi ddle East became increasingly volatile at \\nthe end of 2023. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is not \\nhaving a significant effect on the BMW Group’s business at pre-\\nsent as the Group does not operate directly in that region. How-\\never, it must be assumed that the threat posed in the Red Sea by \\nthe Houthi militia will cause some logistical challenges in 2024. \\nOur outlook does not account for any further escalation of the sit-\\nuation. The BMW Group is monitoring developments. \\nThe war in Ukraine and its potential implications for the \\nBMW Group’s course of business are also being closely moni-\\ntored. All applicable restrictions resulting from sanctions have \\nbeen factored into the outlook.  \\nIn view of the growing unpredictability of political developments, \\nactual macroeconomic and geopolitical developments in some \\nregions may deviate from expected trends and outcomes. Poten-\\ntial sources of political uncertainty include policies affecting trade \\nand customs tariffs, security developments and a possible wors-\\nening of international trade conflicts. \\nOutlook for the BMW Group – key performance indicators \\nDeliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls -Royce brand vehicles in the \\nAutomotive segment are expected to rise slightly year -on-year \\ndue to a slight increase in demand, full availability of new models \\nand model launches. In this context, the share of all-electric ve-\\nhicles relative to total deliveries is expected to increase signifi-\\ncantly compared to 2023. \\nAn EBIT margin of between 8 and 10% is forecast for the Auto-\\nmotive segment in 2024. The RoCE for the Automotive segment \\nis also being affected by the increasing investment in electrifica-\\ntion and digitalisation, and expected to be between 15 and 20%.  \\nThe BMW Group expects to achieve its target of slightly reducing \\nthe carbon emissions generated by its EU new vehicle fleet by \\nfurther improving the overall fuel consumption of its products and \\ndeploying an increasing number of vehicles with electric \\ndrivetrain systems. It is therefore expected that we will continue \\nto remain significantly under the legal limits. \\nA moderate reduction is expected in carbon emissions from \\nBMW Group plants per vehicle produced (Scope 1 and 2) due to \\nincreased production volumes and BMW making greater use of \\ngreen energy. \\n \\n '),\n",

The EBIT margin is expected to be between 8% and \\n10% and the segment RoCE between 21% and 26%. \\nThe RoE in the Financial Services segment is predicted to finish \\nbetween 14% and 17%. As expected, the supply of and demand \\nfor pre-owned vehicles is continuing to stabilise. It is therefore to \\nbe expected that revenues from remarketing lease returns will fall \\nfurther as compared to 2023.  \\nGroup profit before tax will decrease slightly. As the BMW Group \\ncontinues to take a leading role among its competitors in the dig-\\nitalisation and electrification of the vehicle fleet and intends to \\nstrengthen this position, expenses associated with future pro-\\njects will remain high in the Automotive segment in 2024.

We draw on the expertise of climate experts in \\norder to evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities. The re-\\nsponsibilities and tasks of the centralised risk management func-\\ntion, Network Representatives and climate experts are docu-\\nmented and accepted. All material risks are firstly presented for \\nreview to the Risk Management Steering Committee, which is \\nchaired by Group Controlling. Any material risks are then re-\\nported to both the Board of Management and the Supervisory \\nBoard’s Audit Committee. \\nOther functions such as Group Compliance and the Internal Con-\\ntrol System (ICS) form key interfaces to the risk management \\nsystem.

For this purpose, the \\npotential earnings impact of the risks is aggregated, taking cor-\\nrelation effects into account. In order to assess the risk-bearing \\ncapacity of the BMW  Group, the aggregated amount of risks is \\ncompared with the risk cover amount (the equity of the \\nBMW Group recognised for accounting purposes). A limit system \\nfor various risks helps monitor the risk-bearing capacity. \\nReputational risks \\nQuite apart from the financial consequences, risks can also have \\nan impact on the BMW Group’s reputation. For these purposes, \\nthe BMW Group assesses all material risks with regard to their \\nimpact on its reputation using a scoring model. Moreover, oth er \\noverarching topics are monitored by means of regular media \\nanalysis. Any material reputational repercussions are described \\nin the section ↗ Material Short-Term Risks and Opportunities. \\nClimate-related risks \\nRisks associated with climate change are presented in the sec-\\ntion ↗ Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities. Climate-related risks are \\nevaluated as physical and transitory risks in accordance with the \\nrecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Finan-\\ncial Disclosures (TCFD). Transitory risks arise from the transition \\nto a low-carbon economy and are evaluated with the help of cli-\\nmate-related risk drivers and qualitative expert assessments. \\nPhysical risks arise due to climate change and are evaluated us-\\ning external data on potential natural hazards. Potential short -\\nterm impacts of climate change are already included in the short-\\nterm risks. All short-term risks are evaluated for their climate im-\\npact. If a risk is categorised as climate -relevant, the climate-re-\\nlated portion of the risk is determined. The potential development \\nof climate-related risks is evaluated for two reporting periods \\n(medium-term until 2035 and long -term until 2050) and for \\nthree global warming scenarios. \\nNon-financial risks as reported in the non-financial \\nstatement (NFS) \\nAlongside the maintenance of a comprehensive system of risk \\nmanagement, sustainability constitutes a core strategic principle \\nof the BMW Group. Risks resulting from sustainability issues are \\ngenerally identified via the Group -wide risk management \\nnetwork. \\nIn accordance with §  289c of the German Commercial Code \\n(HGB), risks that could have an impact on the non -financial as-\\npects referred to in the relevant legislation are reviewed as part \\nof the reporting process. Material risks in this context are defined \\nas those stemming from business activities, business relation-\\nships and products and services provided by the BMW Group \\nthat are highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact. No ma-\\nterial non-financial risks were identified during the reporting year. \\nOpportunity management \\nIdentifying opportunities is an integral part of the BMW  Group’s \\nstrategic planning process. The Group’s range of products and \\nservices is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses. \\nThe continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict \\ncost controls are also essential factors for ensuring high levels of \\nprofitability and returns on capital employed. \\nThe importance of short -term opportunities for the BMW Group \\nis classified on a qualitative basis in the categories “material” and \\n“immaterial”.

A prolonged war be-\\ntween Russia and Ukraine as well as further escalation of the \\nconflict in the Middle East could also significantly strain the global \\neconomy. The present fragility of the Chinese economy poses an \\nextra risk to sales.  \\nOn balance, neither the Board of Management nor the Super vi-\\nsory Board see any threat to the BMW Group’s status as a going \\nconcern at the balance sheet date or at the date on which the \\nGroup Financial Statements were drawn up. As in the previous \\nyear, the current set of risks to the BMW Group are considered to \\nbe manageable.

The level of risk continues to be \\nclassified as high. \\nWith regard to the war in Ukraine, there is a risk of a further es-\\ncalation of the conflict and therefore of further sanctions imposed \\nby Western countries on Russia as well as possible counter-\\nsanctions and/or retaliatory measures by Russia. Withdrawal of \\nUS support for Ukraine could have major ramifications for the \\ncourse of the war.  \\nFurther escalation of the conflict in the Middle East could nega-\\ntively impact the price of oil, which in turn could lead to rising in-\\nflation rates. \\nIn the trade war between the US and China, the focus is currently \\nshifting from simple tariff increases to further import and export \\nrestrictions on specific technologies. This could also lead to less \\nfavourable import and export conditions for the BMW Group. \\nWith the recent anti -dumping and anti-subsidy probe launched \\nagainst China (the EU is examining, among other things, whether \\nsubsidies for electric vehicles produced in China lead to distorted \\ncompetition), the EU is also considering imposing punitive tariffs \\non the People’s Republic, which in turn increases the risk of a \\ntrade war between the two parties. An escalation of the conflict \\ncould have negative consequences for trade between Europe \\nand China, resulting in both sales risks and risks in the supply \\nchain. \\nAnother risk is of rec ession in Europe and the United States. In \\nboth regions, interest rates were raised considerably in order to \\ncurb inflation. Inflation rates have significantly decreased by this \\npoint and the majority of economies have continued to grow de-\\nspite the interest rate hikes – labour markets have shown partic-\\nular resilience. However, monetary policy measures such as in-\\nterest rate hikes often take effect with some delay and could \\ntherefore slow down the economy in 2024, posing a risk to sales. \\nThe present fragility of the Chinese economy also represents a \\nrisk to sales. If the situation in the real estate sector were to de-\\nteriorate further, the potential impacts on the economy would be \\nsignificantly felt. \\nTo mitigate the effects, sales markets are being monitored on an \\nongoing basis, and individual measures are being defined by \\nstandardised processes and committees. \\nAt the moment, macroeconomic opportunities that could influ-\\nence the earnings situation of the BMW Group positively in the \\nlong term are rather unlikely to materialise. If significantly more \\npositive economic development were to occur in a market due to \\nstronger fiscal or monetary policy measures, this could certainly \\nhave a positive impact.  \\nStrategic and sector-specific risks and opportunities \\nChanges in legislation and regulatory requirements \\nThe introduction of more stringent legislation and regulations, \\nparticularly regarding emissions, safety and consumer protection \\nas well as regional vehicle-related purchase and usage taxes, \\nposes a significant risk for the automobile industry.  \\nCountry- and sector-specific trade barriers can also be subject to \\nchange at short notice. Any tightening up of regulations could ne-\\ncessitate significantly increased investments and costs, influence \\ncustomer behaviour, and lead to interruptions in supply. The risk \\nis categorised as high. \\nThe BMW  Group is seeing increasingly stringent vehicle emis-\\nsions regulations for conventional drive systems. In December \\n2023, a political deal was reached in the EU on the Euro 7 reg-\\nulation. Risks may arise from the details of the regulation still to \\nbe finalised by the European Commission. In addition to pollutant \\nemissions, brake particle emissions, tyre abrasion and high-volt-\\nage battery durability (BEV, PHEV) are also being regulated for \\nthe first time. Following the implementation of Euro 7, additional \\ntargeted tightening measures are anticipated around 2030. \\nThe legally required fleet-wide carbon emissions target in the EU \\nhas been reduced to 0 g/km for 2035, thus requiring complete \\nelectrification of the passenger car new vehicle fleet by 2035. \\nMoreover, the European Commission is working on a proposal to \\ndetermine if and how vehicles powered exclusively by e-fuels can \\nbe recognised as zero-emission vehicles. In 2026, a review will \\ntake place during which the necessary framework conditions to \\nachieve the zero emissions target in 2035 will be analysed. Risks \\ncan arise from the availability of renewable energies, inadequate \\nprivate and public charging infrastructure as well as limited ac-\\ncess to resources for the construction of electric drives. A discus-\\nsion of consumption values and carbon emissions may have an \\nimpact on the Company’s reputation. \\nChanges in trade policies could also have a positive impact on \\nthe BMW Group’s earnings in the short to medium term. Any re-\\nduction in tariff barriers, import restrictions or direct excise duties \\ncould result in lower manufacturing costs or enable products and \\nservices to be offered to customers at more attractive prices. Op-\\nportunities potentially arising from changes in legislation and \\nregulations are classified as immaterial. \\nMarket developments \\nThe constant change in consumer preferences or an altered \\nbrand perception pose both risks and opportunities. For instance, \\nthe BMW Group could be confronted with short-term disruptions \\nin both supply and demand during the transition from conven-\\ntionally powered vehicles to alternative drive systems. The likeli-\\nhood of market risks occurring may be categorised as high.  \\nThe sales markets of the BMW  Group are constantly monitored \\nin order to minimise risks, meet customer requirements and, at '),\n",

Opportunities arising as a result are classified \\nas immaterial. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to production and technologies \\nPlant downtime is the main risk affecting production. Disruptions \\nto production can have various causes, including equipment and \\ntool shortages, supplier bottlenecks, scarcity or shortages of pro-\\nduction resources such as gas or electricity, as well as problems \\nwith logistics. Furthermore, IT disruptions caused by cyber - \\nattacks, for example, are playing an increasingly significant role \\nin disruptions to the supply chain and production. Damage to the \\nfactory infrastructure, caused by fire or natural events such as \\nhail, storms or heavy rainfall, can lead to production downtime. \\nThe risk level for the occurrence of such risks is assessed as high. \\nAll BMW  Group plants have implemented measures for risk \\navoidance and reduction. These include, for example, predictive \\nmaintenance. The risk of production downtime due to parts sup-\\nply is reduced via measures related to logistics, purchasing and \\nthe use of the production network.  \\nA variety of measures are also being taken to prevent and coun-\\nteract longer downtimes of manufacturing equipment due to tar-\\ngeted cyberattacks. \\nPotential natural hazards are already taken into account when \\nselecting a site and through the implementation of measures \\nduring construction. The risk posed by natural hazards or fire is \\nreduced by the use of on-site fire services and employee training. \\nRisks resulting from property -related damage and damage due \\nto downtime, as well as transport damage to vehicles already \\nmanufactured, are transferred to highly solvent ins urance com-\\npanies. Due to the volatility of the international insurance mar-\\nkets, the BMW Group itself bears significant risks today. This so-\\nlution may become increasingly relevant if premiums and de-\\nductibles continue to rise. \\nPotential short-term changes to the relevant legislation and reg-\\nulations or changes in their national interpretation by the author-\\nities may jeopardise our ability to receive type approvals in good \\ntime and, in extreme cases, may lead to the non -admission of a \\nvehicle derivative, sub-market or even a complete market. This, \\nalong with a delayed start of production for new models, could \\nlead to sales losses. Numerous control points have been imple-\\nmented as part of the homologation process in order to identify \\nand mitigate risks. \\nProduct recalls can lead to additional costs. The BMW Group es-\\ntablishes appropriate provisions for statutory and non -statutory \\nwarranty obligations. It cannot be ruled out, however, that addi-\\ntional costs could be incurred that are either not covered or not \\nfully covered by these provisions. Despite the deployment of \\nthorough quality assurance processes, such risks can always \\narise if the materials and/or processing procedures used prove \\ninsufficient – in some cases years after a product has been \\nlaunched. A high number of recalls could also have a negative \\nimpact on the BMW  Group’s reputation. Further information on \\nrisks in conjunction with provisions for statutory and non -statu-\\ntory warranty obligations is provided in ↗ Note [34] to the Group \\nFinancial Statements. \\nThe BMW Group sees opportunities relating to production pro-\\ncesses primarily in the competitive edge gained from mastering \\nnew and complex technologies. Given the long lead times in-\\nvolved in developing new products, additional opportunities are \\nnot expected to have a significant earnings impact on the \\nBMW Group. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to purchasing \\nThe greatest risk relating to purchasing comes from supply \\nshortages due to supplier bottlenecks. Production problems at \\nthe supplier level could lead to consequences caused by in-\\ncreased expenditure for the BMW Group due to production inter-\\nruptions and a corresponding reduction in vehicle sales. Supply \\nbottlenecks may also have a negative impact on the reputation \\nof the BMW Group if customer deman d cannot be met as \\nexpected.  \\nPotential reasons for the failure of suppliers to deliver include the \\nlack of availability of raw materials, energy and other input ma-\\nterials, the occurrence of natural hazards and/or fires, develop-\\nments in the security situation of a country, IT -related risks and \\nnon-compliance with sustainability or quality standards. The risk \\nis categorised as high. \\nDuring the selection of suppliers a standardised assessment of \\nrisk criteria is part of the sourcing process. \\nAn increasing complexity within the supplier network, particularly \\nwith sub-suppliers over which the BMW Group has only an indi-\\nrect influence, as well as a lack of solvency on the part of suppli-\\ners, may influence the delivery of supplies to plants. A prevention \\nprogramme was put in place in order to identify relevant devel-\\nopments early on and define individual measures. \\nAdditional risks arise from the inflation-related price increases of \\nrecent years and the resulting demands from suppliers, which \\ncan have a negative impact on earnings. In addition to price risks, \\nthe number of suppliers at risk of insolvency which the \\nBMW Group must support to maintain supplier operations is \\nincreasing. \\nThe rising threat of cyberattacks along the entire value chain af-\\nfects both the security of supply and the protection of expertise \\nrelevant to the BMW Group. In order to optimise the level of in-\\nformation security throughout the entire value and supply chain, \\nthe BMW  Group requires its suppliers to provide proof of ade-\\nquate information security certification. ↗ Purchasing and Supplier \\nNetwork \\nCost advantages gained by developing local supplier structures \\nnear BMW plants in addition to innovative manufacturing tech-\\nnologies could lead to lower material expenses for the \\nBMW Group. Opportunities arising as a result are classified as \\nimmaterial. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to the sales network \\nn order to sell its products and services, the BMW Group oper-\\nates a global sales network comprising subsidiaries, importers, \\nbranches and independent dealerships. The insolvency of deal-\\nerships may have a negative impact on global vehicle sales and \\nthe range of services available to our customers. '),\n",

Opportuni-\\nties arising as a result are classified as immaterial. \\nInformation security, data protection and IT \\nDigitalisation and automation across all areas of the business \\nand its products offer a wide range of opportunities for the \\nBMW Group. Especially in the field of artificial intelligence, poten-\\ntial uses as well as risks are evaluated on a continuous basis. At \\nthe same time, information technology (IT) requirements regard-\\ning the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information are \\nbecoming increasingly strict. The threat level has continued to \\nrise over recent years. Increasing geopolitical conflicts also con-\\ntribute to the rise in cyberattacks. Moreover, legal and regulatory \\nrequirements are becoming ever stricter worldwide, which could \\nalso necessitate higher investments in hardware and software. \\nIn view of the higher incidence of observed attacks, the risk \\namount – despite extensive security measures – is still classified \\nas high. \\nIn order to protect vehicle functions from manipulation, we have \\nintroduced processes such as standardised safety assessments \\nand regular penetration tests. However, risks in this regard can \\nnever be fully ruled out due to the high complexity and increasing \\nconnectivity. \\nInformation and data can also be compromised by a lack of ris k \\nawareness and inappropriate behaviour. The main direct conse-\\nquences would be negative effects on Group revenues, disrup-\\ntion in production, or reputational damage. For this reason, the \\nBMW Group has launched an interactive programme to provide \\nregular training for every employee on the correct way to handle \\ndangerous emails. \\nProtecting information, for example from unauthorised access or \\nmisuse, has the highest priority. In conjunction with risk manage-\\nment requirements, risks relating to information security, data \\nprotection and IT are systematically documented, allocated ap-\\npropriate measures by the departments concerned and continu-\\nously monitored with regard to threat level and risk mitigation. \\nRegular analyses and controls as well as tight security manage-\\nment policies ensure an appropriate level of security. \\nHowever, despite continuous testing and preventive security \\nmeasures, it is impossible to completely eliminate risks in this \\narea. All authorised persons are required to treat information \\nsuch as confidential business, customer and employee data with \\ngreat care, use information systems securely and handle risks in \\na transparent manner. Uniform requirements that apply through-\\nout the Group are documented in a comprehensive set of rules \\nand guidelines. A consistently applied policy of updating such \\nrules and regulations to the current situation, coupled with regu-\\nlar communication, awareness-raising and training measures, \\nform the basis for a high level of security and risk awareness in \\ngeneral. \\nFinancial risks and risks relating to the use of financial \\ninstruments \\nCurrency risks and opportunities \\nAs an internationally operating enterprise, the BMW  Group con-\\nducts business in a variety of currencies, thus giving rise to cur-\\nrency risks and opportunities. A substantial portion of Group rev-\\nenues, production, other purchases and funding occur outside \\nthe eurozone.  \\nThe BMW  Group manages currency risks at both the strategic \\n(medium to long term) and operational level (short to medium \\nterm). Over the medium and long term, it is possible to ramp up \\nproduction or purchase volumes in foreign currency regions (nat-\\nural hedging). Currency risks are managed in the short to me-\\ndium term and for operational purposes by means of hedging on \\nfinancial markets, the primary objective of which is to improve \\nplanning reliability for the BMW Group as a whole. Regularly up-\\ndated cash-flow-at-risk models are used to limit currency risks \\nand identify opportunities. The risk amount associated with cur-\\nrency risks is classified as high. The strengthening of the euro in \\n2023 has led to an increased level of risk compared to the pre-\\nvious year. \\nDepending on exchange rate fluctuations, opportunities may \\nalso arise, which means they can be considered material. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices \\nAs a manufacturing company, the BMW Group is subject to price \\nrisks, particularly in relation to the raw materials used in vehicle \\nproduction. \\nThe analysis of raw materials price risks is based on planned pur-\\nchases of raw materials and components containing those prod-\\nucts. A cash-flow-at-risk model is deployed to measure risks re-\\nlating to raw materials prices. Price fluctuations for raw materials \\nsuch as precious metals, non -ferrous metals, raw materials for \\nbatteries and steel, and also energy, are hedged using financial \\nderivatives and supply contracts with fixed pricing arrangements. \\nThe prices of many raw materials continue to be subject to un-\\ncertainty on commodity markets. Accordingly, the risk amount \\nassociated with raw materials prices is classified as medium, but \\nthere are also material opportunities. This risk is lower than in the \\nprevious year due to the decline in prices of raw materials.  \\nLiquidity risks \\nThe major part of the Financial Services segment’s credit financ-\\ning and leasing business is refinanced on capital markets. The \\nrisk of restricted access to funds is deemed low. \\nThe liquidity concept, based on the experience gained during the \\nglobal financial crisis, is rigorously adhered to and continuously \\ndeveloped. In the Financial Services segment, the use of the \\n“matched funding principle” ensures that liquidity risks are gen-\\nerally avoided. \\nSolvency is assured at all times throughout  the BMW Group by \\nadhering to liquidity ratios and using a broadly diversified range \\nof refinancing sources. \\nThe liquidity position is monitored continuously and managed \\nthrough the Group-wide planning of financial requirements and \\nfunding. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial \\ninstruments is provided in ↗ Note [40] to the Group Financial State-\\nments. '),\n",

Counterparty risk denotes \\nthe risk that the BMW \\u202fGroup will not receive, or not receive in full, \\nthe payments due to it in connection with the investment and \\nhedging transactions referred to above. A value-at-risk model is \\nemployed to measure counterparty risk, taking into account the \\ncreditworthiness of the banks and the business volumes in-\\nvolved. Risk is managed using a limit system, which includes \\ndaily monitoring of the extent to which limits are being utilised at \\nthe level of the individual counterparties. \\nThe BMW Group holds equity investments of varying amounts in \\nnumerous entities. The recoverability of these investments is \\nmonitored on an ongoing basis as part of a standardised pro-\\ncess. However, risks from impairment losses could still arise. \\nThe risk associated with other financial risks is classified as me-\\ndium. Potential opportunities resulting from the revaluation of in-\\nvestments are evaluated as immaterial. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to pension obligations \\nFuture pension obligations are financed largely via external pen-\\nsion funds or trust constructs that are legally separate from the \\nBMW Group. Externally managed funds are invested on capital \\nmarkets in a broadly diversified portfolio with a view to enabling \\nfuture pension payments to be disbursed out of pension assets. \\nThese arrangements greatly reduce the need to fund pension \\npayments out of ongoing operations. Fluctuations in pension \\nprovisions and the related pension assets give rise to risks that \\nmay have varying effects due to the differences in accounting \\nstandards between IFRS and HGB. \\nThe risk associated with pension provisions based on IFRS val-\\nuations is categorised as medium. Material opportunities can \\narise if the value of pension assets on the capital markets devel-\\nops favourably or if pension provisions decreased at a more pro-\\nnounced rate than the related assets. \\nPension obligations are chiefly measured by projecting future \\npayouts, gauged with a current discount rate derived from mar-\\nket yields from top -rated corporate bonds. This discount rate is \\nsubject to market fluctuations and therefore influences the level \\nof pension obligations in terms of present value. Changes in \\nother parameters, such as inflation rates and life expectancy, \\nalso impact the amount as well as the duration of future pension \\npayments. Regulatory requirements may also affect the amount \\nof pension obligations. \\nThe fluctuation of pension assets reflects the volatility of various \\nasset classes on capital markets. Investments are broadly diver-\\nsified (interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other \\nasset classes). \\nReevaluations on the liabilities and assets sides are recognised \\nnet of deferred taxes through other comprehensive income and \\nhence directly in equity of the BMW  Group (within revenue re-\\nserves). Further information on risks in conjunction with pension \\nprovisions is provided in ↗ Note [33] to the Group Financial State-\\nments. \\nLegal risks \\nLike all entities with international operations, the BMW Group is \\nconfronted with legal disputes, alleged claims relating in particu-\\nlar to warranty and product liability or intellectual property rights \\ninfringements and proceedings initiated by government agen-\\ncies. Any of these could, amongst other conse quences, have an \\nadverse impact on the Group’s reputation. Such proceedings are \\ntypical for the sector, may result as a consequence of realigning \\nproduct or purchasing strategies to changed market conditions, \\nor are antitrust related. Particularly in the US market, class action \\nlawsuits and product liability risks can have substantial financial \\nconsequences and cause damage to the Group’s reputation. \\nMore rigorous application, interpretation of, or changes to, exist-\\ning regulations could result in a greater number of recalls.  \\nThe level of risk from legal risks is classified as medium. \\nThe potential financial impact of the matters covered under con-\\ntingent liabilities, including those related to legal and warranty \\nrisks, cannot be conclusively assessed at this stage. \\nInternational movements of goods require compliance with ex-\\ntensive export control regulations. In addition to goods-related \\nrestrictions, international trading may also involve personal, \\ncountry-specific and end -use-related restrictions. In particu lar, \\nnon-compliance with applicable EU and US export control regu-\\nlations could result in significant legal consequences for the \\nBMW Group. In light of its strong presence in the USA and China, \\nany intensification of the trade dispute between the two countries \\ncould be a potential source of additional risk exposure. \\nBMW Group companies are subject to governmental tax and \\ncustoms audits in each country where they operate, potentially \\nresulting in back taxes, retrospective customs duties, interest, \\npenalties and similar payments. Payments of this nature may, for \\ninstance, result from the non-recognition of inter-company trans-\\nfer prices in the countries concerned. Further substantial legal \\nrisks may emerge from contested interpretations of tax or cus-\\ntoms legislation. The findings of the tax audit in the countries are \\neffective for the audit period and, if applicable, in subsequent \\nyears. Risk management relating to tax and customs legislation \\nis enshrined in the BMW Group’s RMS. In order to minimise ma-\\nterial procedural tax and customs risks, the BMW  Group has set \\nup a comprehensive Tax Compliance Management System (Tax \\nCMS) that is already being applied in its major entities in Ger-\\nmany, China and, since the end of 2023, Austria, and will be \\nrolled out successively in other major countries. \\nThe BMW Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for \\nlawsuits and risks. In addition, a part of these risks is insured to \\nan economically reasonable extent. Nevertheless, it cannot be \\nruled out that damages may occur in excess of the insured \\namounts. In accordance with International Financial Reporting \\nStandards (IFRS), the required information is not provided if the \\nBMW Group concludes that disclosure of the information could \\nseriously prejudice the outcome of the relevan t legal proceed-\\nings. Further information on contingent liabilities is provided in \\n↗ Note [39] to the Group Financial Statements. '),\n",

In \\naddition to this, there are a wide range of guidelines in place \\nworldwide that are implemented by the individual companies in \\nthe Group. \\nThe central goal of risk management in the Financial Services \\nsegment is the continuous assurance of risk-bearing capacity. \\nLimits are assigned depending on the type of risk.

Further-\\nmore, the credit portfolio is evaluated on an ongoing basis with \\nthe aim of determining if any impairment allowances need to be \\nmade for financial receivables. This evaluation is based on sta-\\ntistical methods and takes into account the following aspects, \\namong others: the creditworthiness of the customer, the cus-\\ntomer’s payment history and the economic context in the cus-\\ntomer’s region. The amount allocated to credit risks remains cat-\\negorised as medium. \\nThere may be positive effects in the ongoing assessment of the \\nportfolio’s creditworthiness that lead to a reduction of the overall \\nrisk and therefore constitute an opportunity. The BMW Group \\ncontinues to classify potential opportunities in this area as imma-\\nterial. In order to take account of the volatile economic environ-\\nment, parameters within the credit awarding process were re-\\nviewed and adjusted to factor in or not accept declining credit \\nratings. \\n \\n \\n \\nResidual value risks and opportunities \\nResidual value risks are classified as high in terms of their risk \\nlevel, while residual value opportunities are deemed significant. \\nThey arise primarily when leased vehicles are sold after they are \\nreturned at the end of the leasing period. A negative deviation \\nfrom the residual value forecast results in a residual value risk, \\nwhile a positive deviation represents a residual value oppor-\\ntunity. \\nEach lease contract is assigned a forecasted sales value for the \\nvehicle at the end of the lease term. Current market trends are \\ntaken into consideration within the routine portfolio evaluation. In \\naddition, the portfolio composition (e.g. by drivetrain type) is an-\\nalysed on an ongoing basis. Relevant changes and their impacts \\nare incorporated into the portfolio evaluation. The residual value \\ncalculation models, as well as the portfolio evaluation models, \\nare continually being refined. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nInterest rate risks \\nTo a limited degree, interest rate risks are deli berately accepted \\nin order to make use of the associated return potential.

Potential impacts \\nare grouped into five different levels. \\nIn the Paris Agreement global warming scenario, the potential \\ntransitory risks are deemed the highest over the medium term as \\na result of the fast-paced, sometimes unforeseeable develop-\\nments. It cannot be ruled out that more decisive measures will \\nhave to be taken globally in the next few years in order to achieve \\nthe < +1.5°C target. For the BMW Group, this is reflected primar-\\nily in the risk dimensions of “Politics, legal affairs and regulatory \\nframework”, as well as “Market and competition”. Regulatory re-\\nquirements introduced at short notice may enter into force, which \\ncould have an impact on products, production and supply chains. \\nIn the “Market and competition” risk dimension, risks may also \\nincrease due to higher demand and the resulting higher prices for \\nselect (scarce) raw materials on the one hand and due to rising \\nenergy prices on the other. \\nTransitory climate risks \\n \\nPhysical climate risks \\nIn addition to the transitory risks, the BMW Group also evaluates \\nphysical risks. In doing so, the increasing frequency and intensity \\nof acute extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms \\nand floods, are taken into account, along with longer-term \\nchanges such as in terms of temperature and rainfall. \\nIn order to measure such risks, we draw on external data that \\nevaluate the development of acute and persistent natural phe-\\nnomena across the global warming scenarios and across time. \\nFor the BMW Group, this may result in damage to assets such as \\nbuildings, vehicles or parts on the one hand, and on the other \\nhand, such events may lead to downtime at BMW Group sites or \\nat suppliers’ sites. \\nPhysical climate risks also increase for the BMW Group particu-\\nlarly in the long-term >+4 °C scenario. This leads to a higher risk \\nboth for the BMW Group’s production sites and also for suppliers’ \\nsites.

The CMS focuses on adequacy and effectiveness \\nand is based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond model, which de-\\nfines specific preventive, monitoring, control and response \\nmeasures. Clear assignment of roles and responsibilities is also \\nessential. \\nThe CMS is tailored to the BMW  Group’s risk situation and ad-\\ndresses all relevant compliance topics. Group -wide, these in-\\nclude anti corruption and fraud prevention, anti-money-launder-\\ning, antitrust and human rights compliance, export control com-\\npliance, data privacy protection and product compliance. In the \\nreporting year, the already established compliance programmes \\nExternal Workforce Compliance and Compliance for regulated Fi-\\nnancial Services Units were incorporated into the CMS.

The objective is to consistently improve the \\nCMS. The BMW Group is an active member of various associa-\\ntions and interest groups, including the German Institute f or \\nCompliance e. V. (DICO), at Board level. \\nDuring the reporting period, a key area of focus was the updating \\nand further development of the compliance regulatory land-\\nscape. This included an update of the ↗ BMW Group Code of Conduct \\nas the central policy for the BMW Group’s expectations of its em-\\nployees in terms of compliance with applicable legal provisions \\nand internal regulations. An analysis of the BMW Group’s activi-\\nties to further improve antitrust compliance was also carried out. \\nFurther priority areas emerged in the context of export control, \\ndue to the war in Ukraine, and in anti -money-laundering efforts, \\ndue to the increase in legislative initiatives as well as in anticipa-\\ntion of changes to the business model aiming to intensify direct \\nsales. \\nOne component of the CMS is the compliance programme Data \\nPrivacy Protection, which is the responsibility of the department \\nGroup Data Privacy Protection. This is based on the directive Pri-\\nvacy Corporate Rules and the so-called Binding Corporate Rules, \\nwhich contractually protect the transfer of employee data within \\nthe BMW Group.

The ICS \\nfor non-financial reporting focuses primarily on the further devel-\\nopment of the processes used to gather data as the basis for re-\\nporting the non-financial performance indicators disclosed in the \\nBMW Group Report. \\nThe ICS is based on the “three lines” model, including a clear def-\\ninition of how the various functions are required to interact with \\none another in order to manage risks. As a component of the \\nsecond line, the ICS serves as the link between the operating \\nunits (first line) and Corporate Audit (third line). \\nIn principle, the ai m of every appropriate and effective ICS is to \\nprevent potential risks in external financial and non -financial re-\\nporting or reduce the likelihood of potential risks materialising. \\nInternationally acknowledged standards for internal control sys-\\ntems were taken into account when designing the various ele-\\nments of the ICS deployed by the BMW  Group (e.g. COSO \\nmodel2). \\nThe principal features of the BMW Group’s ICS are a role-based \\napproach embedded throughout the organisation, a clearly de-\\nfined control environment that is underpinned by a combination \\nof risk assessment procedures, control activities, information and \\ncommunication, and monitoring activities. \\nBoth the system itself and the methods applied are subject to \\ncontinuous improvement, with its functionality being assessed \\non a regular basis. Notwithstanding the measures taken, every \\ncontrol system is subject to inherent limitations, given that it is \\nnot possible to prevent all incorrect disclosures or detect them in \\na timely manner. \\nRelevant BMW  Group workin g instructions and guidelines for \\nrecognising, measuring and allocating items to accounts as well \\nas definitions of non-financial performance indicators are avail -\\nable to all employees via the BMW Group’s intranet system. New \\nreporting standards are assess ed for their potential impact on \\nthe BMW Group’s reporting. \\nThe principle of segregation of duties is taken into account for all \\nIT systems that are relevant for accounting and financial report-\\ning. ICS requirements are also embedded in the ongoing devel-\\nopment of all IT systems used in these areas. Furthermore, the \\nBMW Group deploys data analysis tools to identify and subse-\\nquently eliminate any weaknesses detected in its processes \\nand/or control systems. \\nResponsibilities for ensuring the appropriateness and  effective-\\nness of ICS procedures for accounting and financial reporting \\nprocesses as well as those relating to non-financial performance \\nindicators are clearly defined in a role-based model and allocated \\nto the relevant line and process managers. They report annually \\non their assessment of the ICS for accounting and financial re-\\nporting processes and the processes for non-financial perfor-\\nmance indicators. The assessment takes into account the results \\nof internal and external audits as well as the results of continuous \\nmonitoring. The results of the assessment are gathered and doc-\\numented in a centralised IT system.

The term \\n“control” is defined as the acquisition of more than 50% of \\nthe share capital of BMW AG, the right to receive more than \\n50% of the dividend, or the right to direct the affairs of the \\nCompany or appoint the majority of members of the \\nSupervisory Board. \\n― BMW AG is the guarantor for all obligations u nder the \\nagreement regarding the joint venture BMW  Brilliance \\nAutomotive Ltd. in China. This agreement generally grants \\nan extraordinary right of termination to either joint venture \\npartner in the event of a change of control at either one of \\nthe parties, or if more than 25% of the shares of the other \\nparty are acquired by a third party – either directly or \\nindirectly – or if the other party is merged with another legal \\nentity. Termination of the joint venture agreement may lead \\nto the dissolution of the joint venture, with an optional \\npurchase right for BMW AG (or the partner) to acquire the \\nshares of the other partner or to the liquidation of the joint \\nventure company. \\n― BMW AG has entered into framework agreements with \\ncredit institutions for trading in derivative financial \\ninstruments (ISDA Master Agreements). In the event of a \\nsignificant deterioration in creditworthiness, the contracting \\nparties are entitled to terminate the agreement with \\nimmediate effect if the deterioration in creditworthiness \\nresults from a direct or indirect acquisition of the majority of \\nthe capital in a contracting party, which confers the right to \\nelect the majority of the Supervisory Board members (or a \\ncomparable body) on a contracting party, from any other \\ntransaction that enables control over a contracting party or \\nfrom a merger or transfer of assets. In the event of \\nextraordinary termination, all current transactions will be \\nsettled. \\n― BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz Group AG have entered into \\na joint venture agreement relating to mobility services, which \\nincludes the areas of ride-hailing and vehicle charging, and \\nentitles both Mercedes -Benz Group AG and BMW AG \\n(hereafter referred to as “principals”) to initiate a bidding \\nprocedure in the event that (i) the other principal receives \\nnotice in accordance with §  33 of the German Securities \\nTrading Act (WpHG) that – including shares attributed \\npursuant to § 34 WpHG – a shareholding of more than 50% \\nhas been attained or, in accordance with §  20 of the \\nGerman Stock Corporation Act (AktG) that a shareholding of \\nmore than 50% has been attained, or (ii) a shareholder or a \\nthird party – including shares attributed pursuant to §  30 \\nWpHG – holds more than 50% of the voting rights or shares \\nin the other principal, or (iii) the other principal has concluded \\na control agreement as a dependent company. The \\noutcome of such a bidding procedure is that the joint venture \\nwill go to the principal making the highest bid. \\n― Several supply and development contracts between \\nBMW AG and various industrial customers re lating to the \\nsale of components for drivetrain systems, grant an \\nextraordinary right of termination to the relevant industrial \\ncustomer in specified cases of a change in control at \\nBMW AG (for example if BMW AG merges with a third party \\nor is taken over by a third party; an automobile manufacturer \\nacquires more than 50% of the voting rights or share capital \\nof BMW AG). \\n― BMW AG is party to the shareholder agreement relating to \\nThere Holding B.V., which is the majority shareholder of the \\nHERE Group. In accordance with the shareholder \\nagreement, each contracting party is required to offer its \\ndirectly or indirectly held shares in There Holding B.V. for \\nsale to the other shareholders in the event of a change of \\ncontrol.

Pursuant to §  325 HGB, the Group Finan-\\ncial Statements and the Group Management Report are required \\nto be submitted electronically to the operator of the German \\nCompany Register and made accessible via that agency’s web-\\nsite. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG), \\nwhich has its seat in Germany, Munich, Petuelring 130, is regis-\\ntered in the Commercial Register of the District Court of Munich \\nunder the number HRB 42243. BMW AG manufactures automo-\\nbiles and motorcycles in the premium segment. \\nThe Group Financial Statements have been drawn up in euro s. \\nAll amounts are disclosed in millions of euros (€ million) unless \\nstated otherwise. \\nKey figures presented in this report have been rounded in ac-\\ncordance with standard commercial practise. In certain cases, \\nthis may mean that values do not add up exactly to the stated \\ntotal and that percentages cannot be derived from the values \\nshown. \\nThe income statement for the BMW Group and segments is pre-\\nsented using the cost of sales method.  \\n \\n \\n \\nIn order to provide a better insight into the results of operations, \\nfinancial position and net assets of the BMW Group, and going \\nbeyond the requirements of IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the \\nGroup Financial Statements also include an income statement \\nand a balance sheet for the Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial \\nServices and Other Entities segments. The Group Cash Flow \\nStatement is supplemented by a statement of cash flows for the \\nAutomotive and Financial Services segments. Inter-segment \\ntransactions relate primarily to internal sales of products, the pro-\\nvision of funds for Group companies and the related interest. A \\ndescription of the nature of the business and the major operating \\nactivities of the BMW Group’s segments is provided in ↗ note 46 \\n(Explanatory notes to segment information). \\nApproval for the publication of the Group Financial Statements \\nwas granted by the Board of Management on 12 March 2024. \\n02 Group reporting entity and consolidation principles \\nThe BMW Group Financial Statements include BMW AG and all \\nmaterial subsidiaries over which BMW AG – either directly or in-\\ndirectly – exercises control. This also includes 62 structured en-\\ntities, consisting of asset -backed financing arrangements and \\nspecial purpose funds. In some cases, contractual agreements \\nare in place with the asset-backed securities companies to offset \\ntheir losses in connection with residual value risks arising from \\nthe receivables sold to them. \\n \\n \\n \\nIn relation to fully consolidated companies, the following changes \\ntook place in the Group reporting entity in the financial year \\n2023: \\n  Germany  Foreign  Total \\nIncluded at 31 December 2022   20  184  204 \\nIncluded for the first time in 2023   –  18  18 \\nNo longer included in 2023  –  15  15 \\nIncluded at 31 December 2023   20  187  207 \\n    \\nAll consolidated subsidiaries have the same year -end as BMW \\nAG with the exception of BMW India Private Ltd. and BMW India \\nFinancial Services Private Ltd., whose year-ends are 31 March \\nin accordance with local legal requirements. Interim financial \\nstatements are prepared as at 31 December for the two compa-\\nnies with divergent reporting dates. \\nWhen assessing whether an investment gives rise to a controlled \\nentity, an associated company, a joint operation or a joint ven-\\nture, the BMW Group considers contractual arrangements and \\nother circumstances, as well as the structure and legal form of \\nthe entity. Discretionary decisions may also be required. If indi-\\ncations exist of a change in the judgement of (joint) control, the \\nBMW Group undertakes a new assessment. \\nNOTES  TO  THE  GROUP  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/raw/reports/bmw_2023.pdf', 'page': 160}, page_content='161 BMW Group Report 2023  To Our Stakeholders  Combined Management Report  Group Financial Statements  Responsibility Statement and Auditor’s Report  Remuneration Report  Other Information               \\n       Notes to the Group Financial Statements       \\n \\n \\nAn entity is deemed to be controlled if BMW AG – either directly \\nor indirectly – has power over it, is exposed or has rights to vari-\\nable returns from it and has the ability to influence those returns. \\nAn entity is classified as an associated company if BMW  AG – \\neither directly or indirectly – has the ability to exercise significant \\ninfluence over the entity’s operating and financial policies. As a \\ngeneral rule, the Group is assumed to have significant influence \\nif it holds 20% or more of the entity’s voting power. \\nJoint operations and joint ventures are forms of joint arrange-\\nments. Such an arrangement exists when a BMW Group entity \\njointly carries out activities with a third party on the basis of a \\ncontractual agreement. \\nIn the case of a joint operation, the parties that have joint control \\nof the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for \\nthe liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Assets, liabilities, rev-\\nenues and expenses of a joint operation are recognised propor-\\ntionately in the Group Financial Statements on the basis of the \\nBMW Group entity’s rights and obligations (proportionate con-\\nsolidation). The impact of joint operations on the Group Financial \\nStatements is of minor significance. \\nThe BMW Group’s largest joint operation is Spotlight Automotive \\nLimited (Spotlight), which has been operated together with the \\nChinese automobile manufacturer Great Wall Motor Company \\nLimited (Great Wall) since 2019, jointly developing and manu-\\nfacturing electric vehicles for the MINI and Great Wall brands in \\nChina. The BMW Group and Great Wall each hold 50% of the \\njoint operation’s equity. \\nIn the case of a joint venture, the parties which have joint control \\nonly have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. \\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are accou nted for us-\\ning the equity method, with measurement on initial recognition \\nbased on acquisition cost. \\nOn 11 February 2022, via its subsidiary BMW Holding B.V., the \\nBMW Group increased its shareholding in the BMW Brilliance Au-\\ntomotive Ltd. (BMW Brilliance) joint venture from 50% to 75% \\nwith the acquisition of a further 25% of BMW Brilliance’s shares. \\nBMW Brilliance has been fully consolidated in the Group Finan-\\ncial Statements since that date. With regard to the figures re-\\nported for the previous financial year, it should therefore be noted \\nthat BMW Brilliance is only included for the relevant part of 2022 \\n(i.e. from 11 February onwards). If BMW Brilliance had been fully \\nincluded in the Group Financial Statements with effect from 1 \\nJanuary 2022, Group revenues and profit after tax for the finan-\\ncial year 2022 would have amounted to €  145,521 million and \\n€ 18,842 million respectively. The remeasurement of the previ-\\nously held shares resulted in a gain of €  7,649 million on first -\\ntime consolidation, which was recognised in income from invest-\\nments within the line item “Other financial result” in the previous \\nyear. Detailed information is provided in ↗ BMW Group Report 2022, \\nnote [3] to the Group Financial Statements. \\nOn 19 July 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement with the \\ncompanies of the Mercedes -Benz Group AG, the Stellantis \\nGroup, the Honda Group, the Hyundai Motor Group and the Gen-\\neral Motors Company Group to establish a company in Canada \\nwith the aim of developing charging infrastructure in North Amer-\\nica. Following approval by the relevant antitrust authorities, the \\ntransaction was completed on 18 October 2023, with the BMW \\nGroup holding a 16.67% stake. Although this is below 20%, the \\nnewly founded entity is included in the BMW Group Financial \\nStatements as an associated company using the equity method, \\nreflecting the fact that the BMW Group is represented on the \\nmanagement board and therefore has significant influence. \\nOn 6 November 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement \\nwith the Mercedes-Benz Group AG to esta blish a company in \\nChina with the aim of developing a charging infrastructure there. \\nApproval has been granted by the antitrust authorities. The BMW \\nGroup will hold a 50% stake in the newly founded entity. It will \\nbe included in the BMW Group Financial Sta tements as a joint \\nventure using the equity method. \\nOn 30 September 2021, the BMW Group signed an agreement \\nwith the Huachen Group to acquire all of the shares of Brilliance \\nAutomobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd., a Huachen Group subsidi-\\nary. The transaction will not, however, be completed.  \\nThe other changes to the Group reporting entity do not have a \\nmaterial impact on the results of operations, financial position \\nand net assets of the Group. \\n03 Other significant events \\nRussia-Ukraine war \\nMajor uncertainties rem ained at 31 December 2023 with re-\\nspect to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The current sanctions \\nand the countermeasures taken significantly restrict economic \\nactivities with Russia and also have an impact on the Russian \\ncompanies of the BMW Group. \\nThe restrictions currently in place for payments continue to re-\\nstrict the transfer of liquid funds from Russia. Developments in \\nthis area are reviewed by the BMW Group on a regular basis. In \\ntotal, the Russian companies hold around 4% (2022: 5%) of the \\nBMW Group’s cash and cash equivalents. \\nA closing rate of RUB 100.62 (2022: 77.12) to the euro was ap-\\nplied at 31 December 2023 to translate foreign currency items \\ndenominated in Russian roubles. The BMW Group has been able \\nto execute transactions at this rate. '),\n",

Under this method, assets and liabilities are \\ntranslated at the closing exchange rate, while income and ex-\\npenses are translated at the average exchange rate. Differences \\narising on foreign currency translation are presented in “Accu-\\nmulated other equity”. In the single entity accounts of BMW AG \\nand its subsidiaries, for eign currency receivables and payables \\nare measured on initial recognition using the exchange rate pre-\\nvailing at the date of first-time recognition. Advance payments to \\nsuppliers or from customers in a foreign currency that result in \\nthe addition of non-monetary assets or liabilities are recorded at \\nthe exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment. At the end \\nof the reporting period, foreign currency receivables and pay-\\nables are measured using the closing exchange rate. The result-\\ning unrealised gains and losses, as well as realised gains and \\nlosses arising on settlement, are recognised in the income state-\\nment, in line with the underlying substance of the transaction. \\nNon-monetary balance sheet line items denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies are rolled forward on the basis of historical exchange \\nrates. \\nThe exchange rates of currencies which have a material impact \\non the Group Financial Statements were as follows: \\n  Closing rate  Average rate \\n         \\n1 euro =  31.12.2023  31.12.2022  2023  2022 \\nUS dollar  1.11  1.07  1.08  1.05 \\nChinese renminbi  7.86  7.36  7.66  7.08 \\nBritish pound  0.87  0.89  0.87  0.85 \\nJapanese yen  156.58  141.11  151.98  138.02 \\nSouth Korean won  1,435.44  1,346.97  1,412.98  1,357.16 \\n    \\nArgentina has fulfilled the definition of a hyperinflationary econ-\\nomy since 1 July 2018. Since that date, IAS 29 (Financial Re-\\nporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) has therefore been ap-\\nplied for the BMW subsidiary in Argentina. The price indices pub-\\nlished by the Federación Argentina de Consejos Profesionales de \\nCiencias Económicas (FACPCE) are used to adjust non -mone-\\ntary asset, liability and income statement line items. The result-\\ning effects are not material for the BMW Group. \\n  '),\n",

In a Group-wide project, the \\nBMW Group examined the impact of adopting IFRS 17 for exist-\\ning agreements. The BMW Group offers various products that \\nmeet the definition of an insurance contract in accordance with \\nIFRS 17. However, for the majority of these products, either an \\nexemption applies (e.g. for warranty agreements) or the insur-\\nance arrangements qualify as fixed-fee service contracts, which \\ncan continue to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15 due \\nto the option available in IFRS 17. In some markets, however, \\nproducts are offered (e.g. comprehensive vehicle insurance) that \\nare required to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 17. \\nThese contracts can be accounted for using the premium alloca-\\ntion approach, which is essentially the same as the accounting \\nmethod already being applied for such contracts. In the financial \\nyear 2023, insurance premiums for insurance contracts amount-\\ning to € 89 million were recognised in other income within the \\nline item “Revenues”. At 31 December 2023, insurance liabilities \\nfor the remaining terms of these contracts amounted to €  289 \\nmillion. \\nIn May 2023, the IASB published International Tax Reform – Pil-\\nlar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12) which sets out a \\nmandatory exemption to the accounting for deferred taxes in \\nconjunction with the global minimum taxation (Pillar Two). The \\namendments provide for a temporary exemption from recognis-\\ning deferred taxes resulting from the implementation of the Pillar \\nTwo rules. The exemption has accordingly been applied by the \\nBMW Group. The amendments also include disclosures in the \\nnotes to explain the impact of the introduction of minimum taxa-\\ntion on affected entities. The introduction of the Pillar Two regu-\\nlations is not expected to have any significant impact on the \\nBMW Group Financial Statements.  \\nb Financial reporting pronouncements issued by the IASB, but not \\nyet applied \\nOther financial reporting standards and revised standards issued \\nby the IASB that have not yet been applied are not expected to \\nhave any significant impact on the BMW Group Financial State-\\nments. \\nc Accounting policy changes in the financial year 2023 \\nIn order to increase consistency between internal performance \\nmanagement and external reporting, the following accounting \\npolicies were changed in the financial year 2023.  \\nGovernment grants related to assets were previously reported as \\ndeferred income and recognised through profit or loss over the \\naccounting periods in which the costs occur that they are in-\\ntended to compensate. With effect from the financial year 2023, \\ngovernment grants relating to assets are deducted from the car-\\nrying amount of the relevant assets and therefore now recog-\\nnised in profit or loss over the respective useful lives of the assets\\nin the form of reduced depreciation/amortisation. In this context, \\nthe accounting treatment applied for investment tax credits was \\nalso changed. Instead of being recognised immediately as a re-\\nduction of income tax expense, with effect from the financial year \\n2023 investment tax credits are also deducted from the carrying \\namount of the related assets. The income statement impact is \\ntherefore also spread over the respective useful lives of the as-\\nsets in the form of lower depreciation/amortisation expense. The \\nchange in accounting policy has not been applied retrospectively \\non the grounds of immateriality. Prior-year figures have therefore \\nnot been adjusted.  \\nDeferred income for government grants relating to assets at 31 \\nDecember 2022 amounted to € 465 million or 0.19% of Group \\ntotal assets at that date. At 31 December 2023, the correspond-\\ning amount was € 370 million.  \\nAlso with a view to increasing consistency with internal perfor-\\nmance management, with effect from the financial year 2023 \\nadvance payments to suppliers are reported within other assets. \\nAt 31 December 2022, advance payments to suppliers amount-\\ning to € 259 million were reported within inventories. Prior year \\nfigures have not been adjusted on the grounds of immateriality. \\nThe impact of the changes in accounting policy is not material for \\nthe results of operations, financial position and net assets of the \\nBMW Group.

In this context, the BMW Group incurs \\nexpenditure on research and development for electrified models, \\ninvests in resource-saving production facilities for the manufac-\\nture of electrified automobiles and, in particular, is gradually con-\\nverting its production processes from fossil fuels to green energy \\nby concluding long -term power purchase agreements for elec-\\ntricity and gas from renewable sources. \\nAs a consequence of joining the Business Ambition for 1.5°C \\ncampaign led by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), the \\nBMW Group pursues validated SBTi Near Term Targets for the \\nyear 2030, which are incorporated in the Group’s long-term cor-\\nporate plan. \\nThe targets set include a reduction in average carbon emissions \\nof 80% per vehicle produced in our own plants and locations \\n(Scope 1 and Scope 2), an average reduction of more than 50% \\nper kilometre driven in the use phase (Scope 3 downstream) and \\nan average reduction of more than 20% per vehicle in the supply \\nchain (Scope 3 upstream). \\nIn line with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate -\\nrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), both physical and transi-\\ntion-related risks and opportunities are taken into account in the \\nGroup’s internal performance management system and in con-\\njunction with the preparation of the Group Financial Statements. \\nThese aspects, referred to below as “climate- related aspects”, \\nare highly relevant for the preparation of the Group Financial  \\nStatements, particularly in the case of assumptions, judgements \\nand estimations relating to future developments that impact the \\nBMW Group and its environment, and are therefore included in \\ntheir assessment. \\nMore detailed information on how climate -related aspects are \\ntaken into account for recognition and measurement purposes is \\nprovided below, particularly in the comments on property, plant \\nand equipment, leased products and the performance of impair-\\nment tests. This includes an indication of the extent to which cli-\\nmate-related aspects have been taken into account in the est i-\\nmations and assumptions for the recognition and measurement \\nof balance sheet items. \\nRevenues from customer contracts include in particular reve-\\nnues from the sale of products (primarily new and pre-owned ve-\\nhicles and related products) as well as revenues from services. \\nRevenue is recognised when control is transferred to the dealer-\\nship or retail customer. In the case of sales of products, this is \\nusually at the point in time when the risks and rewards of owner-\\nship are transferred. Revenues are stated net of settlement dis-\\ncount, bonuses and rebates as well as interest and residual value \\nsubsidies. The consideration arising from these sales usually \\nfalls due for payment immediately or within 30 days. In excep-\\ntional cases, a longer payment may also be agreed. In the case \\nof services, control is transferred over time. Consideration for the \\nrendering of services to customers usually falls due for payment \\nat the beginning of a contract and is therefore deferred as a con-\\ntract liability. The deferred amount is released over the service \\nperiod and recognised as revenue in the income statement. As a \\nrule, amounts are released on the basis of the expected expense \\ntrend, as this best reflects the performance of the service. If the \\nsale of products includes a determinable amount for services \\n(multiple-component contracts), the related revenues are de-\\nferred and recognised as income in the same way. Variable con-\\nsideration components, such as bonuses, are measured at the \\nexpected value, and in the case of multi -component contracts, \\nallocated to all performance obligations unless directly attribut -\\nable to the sale of a vehicle.  \\nRevenues from the sale of products, for which repurchase ar-\\nrangements are in place, are not recognised immediately in full. \\nInstead, revenues are either recognised proportionately or the \\ndifference between the sales and repurchase price is recognised \\nin instalments over the term of the contract depending on the na-\\nture of the agreement. In the case of vehicles sold to a dealership \\nthat are expected to be repurchased in a subsequent period as \\npart of leasing operations, revenues are not recognised at Group \\nlevel at the time of the sale of the vehicle. Instead, assets and \\nliabilities relating based on the right of return of these vehicles \\nare recognised. \\nRevenues from leases of own-manufactured vehicles are recog-\\nnised at Group level in accordance with the requirements for \\nmanufacturer or dealer leases. In the case of operating leases, \\nrevenues from lease payments are recognised on a straight-line \\nbasis over the lease term. Finance leases, on the other hand, are \\naccounted for as a sale. At the lease commencement date, rev-\\nenues are recognised at the amount of the fair value of the leased \\nasset and reduced by any unguaranteed residual value of vehi-\\ncles that are expected to be returned to the Group at the end of \\nthe lease term. In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as \\ncost of sales at the lease commencement date. \\nRevenues also include interest income from financial services. In-\\nterest income arising on finance leases as well as on retail cus-\\ntomer and dealership financing is recognised using the effective \\ninterest method and reported as interest income on credit financ-\\ning within revenues.

The resulting income \\nis recognised in cost of sales over the periods in which the costs \\noccur that they are intended to compensate. Information on the \\naccounting policy changes applied for the first time from the fi-\\nnancial year 2023 relating to government grants received for as-\\nsets as well as to investment tax credits is provided in ↗ note 5. \\nEarnings per share are calculated as follows: basic earnings per \\nshare are calculated for common and preferred stock by dividing \\nthe net profit for the year (after non-controlling interests) that is \\nattributable to each category of stock, by the average number of \\nshares of each category in circulation. Net profit for the year is \\naccordingly allocated to the different categories of stock. The \\nportion of the net profit that is not being distributed is allocated \\nto each category of stock based on the number of outstanding \\nshares. Profits available for distribution are determined directly \\non the basis of the dividend proposals or resolutions for common \\nand preferred stock. Diluted earnings per share are calculated \\nand separately disclosed in accordance with IAS 33. \\nIntangible assets are measured on initial recognition at acquisi-\\ntion or manufacturing cost. Subsequently, intangible assets with \\nfinite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their \\nuseful lives of between three and 20 years. Impairment losses \\nare recognised where necessary. Intangible assets with indefi-\\nnite useful lives are tested annually for impairment. Internally \\ngenerated intangible assets mainly comprise development costs \\nfor vehicle, module and architecture projects. \\nDevelopment costs are capitalised if all of the criteria specified \\nby IAS  38 are met. They are measured on the basis of direct \\ncosts and directly attributable overhead costs. Project -related \\ncapitalised development costs are amortised on a straight -line \\nbasis following the start of production over the estimated product \\nlife (usually five to 12 years). \\nGoodwill arises when the cost of acquiring a business exceeds \\nthe Group’s share of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and \\ncontingent liabilities identified during the acquisition. \\nIntangible assets also include emission allowances and similar \\nrights arising from programmes aimed at reducing carbon or \\nother climate-damaging emissions (for example in conjunction \\nwith the EU Emissions Trading System or vehicle -related emis-\\nsions regulations in the USA or China). These allowances and \\nrights are carried at cost and, in the event that they are allocated \\nfree of charge, recorded at a value of zero. Amounts are derec-\\nognised when they are returned or, in exceptional cases, when \\nthey are sold or expire. In parallel to the recognition of these al-\\nlowances and rights as assets, provisions are recognised in ac-\\ncordance with IAS 37 corresponding to the amount of obligations \\nexpected to arise in conjunction with the related emissions regu-\\nlations. Provisions are measured on the basis of the expected \\nvalue of the allowances or rights that are to be returned. \\nIf there is any indication of impairment of intangible assets, or \\nif an annual impairment test is required (i.e. intangible assets \\nwith an indefinite useful life, intangible assets during the devel-\\nopment phase and goodwill), an impairment test is performed. \\nEach individual asset is tested separately unless the cash flows \\ngenerated by the asset are not sufficiently independent from the \\ncash flows generated by other assets or other groups of assets. \\nIn these cases, impairment is tested at the level of a cash-gener-\\nating unit, which is the norm for the BMW Group. \\nFor the purpose of  the impairment test, the carrying amount of \\nan asset (or a cash-generating unit) is compared with the recov-\\nerable amount. The first step of the impairment test is to deter-\\nmine the value in use. If the value in use is lower than the carrying \\namount, the next step is to determine the fair value less costs to \\nsell and compare the amount so determined with the asset’s car-\\nrying amount. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount, \\nan impairment loss is recognised, reducing the carrying amount \\nto the higher of the asset’s value in use or fair value less costs to \\nsell. \\nIf the reason for a previously recognised impairment loss no \\nlonger exists, the impairment loss is reversed up to the level of \\nthe recoverable amount, but no higher than the amortised acqui-\\nsition or manufacturing cost. Impairment losses on goodwill are \\nnot reversed. As part of the process of assessing recoverability, \\nit is generally necessary to apply estimations and assumptions – \\nin particular regarding future cash inflows and outflows and th e \\nlength of the forecast period – which could differ from actual \\namounts. Actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and \\nestimations used if business conditions develop differently to  \\nexpectations. \\nThe BMW Group determines the value in use of intangible assets \\non the basis of a present value computation. The cash flows used \\nfor this calculation are derived from the long-term corporate plan \\napproved by management, corresponding to a forecast period of \\nsix years. '),\n",

Forecasting assumptions are adjusted \\nto current information and regularly compared with external \\nsources. The assumptions used take account in particular of ex-\\npectations of the profitability of the product portfolio, future mar-\\nket share development, macroeconomic developments (such as \\ncurrency, interest rate and raw materials prices) as well as the \\nlegal environment and past experience. \\nAssumptions also take into account the impact of climate-related \\naspects and the influence of other sustainability factors on busi-\\nness performance and the product portfolio, for example as a re-\\nsult of changes in demand patterns, regulatory requirements or \\nchanges in production conditions. In line with the BMW Group’s \\nstrategy process and the ongoing transformation to electric mo-\\nbility, the detailed forecast takes account of key assumptions \\nsuch as the planned increase in the share of electrified automo-\\nbiles to over 50% and the required level of expenditure on re-\\nsearch and development for vehicle models with battery-electric \\ndrives. Other matters to be considered are the scale of future in-\\nvestments in resource-saving production facilities (including any \\nexpected efficiency improvements), the cost of converting pro-\\nduction processes from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources \\nand, last but not least, the expected impact on the current leasing \\nportfolio.  \\nAmounts are discounted on the basis of a market-related cost of \\ncapital rate. Impairment tests are performed for accounting and \\nfinancial reporting purposes and using a risk -adjusted pre -tax \\ncost of capital (WACC) for the Automotive (excluding BMW Bril-\\nliance), BMW Brilliance and Motorcycles cash-generating units. \\nIn the case of the Financial Services cash-generating unit, a pre-\\ntax cost of equity capital is used, as is customary in the sector. \\nBy analogous application of the procedures used for the other \\ncash-generating units, the value in use is also determined for the \\nBMW Brilliance cash-generating unit in view of the time period \\nsince the acquisition date. \\nThe following pre-tax discount factors were applied: \\nin %  2023  2022 \\nAutomotive excluding BMW Brilliance   13.7  12.4 \\nBMW Brilliance  15.6  15.4 \\nMotorcycles  13.7  12.4 \\nFinancial Services  15.2  13.7 \\n    \\nThe risk-adjusted discount rate, calculated using a capital asset \\npricing model (CAPM), also takes into account  specific peer -\\ngroup information relating to beta-factors, capital structure data \\nand borrowing costs. No environmental, social and governance \\n(ESG)-related adjustments were made to the WACC. \\nIn conjunction with the impairment tests for cash- generating \\nunits, sensitivity analyses are performed for the main assump-\\ntions in order to rule out that possible changes to the assump-\\ntions used to determine the recoverable amount would result in \\nthe requirement to recognise an impairment loss. Even in the \\ncase of a 10% deterioration in the individual measurement as-\\nsumptions, an impairment loss would not arise. If the WACC were \\nto develop as in the previous year, the value in use calculated for \\nthe Financial Services cash-generating unit would fall slightly be-\\nlow its carrying amount in 2024. The BMW Group does not, how-\\never, expect the WACC to develop as in the previous year. \\nAll items of property, plant and equipment are measured at ac-\\nquisition or manufacturing cost less accumulated depreciation \\nand accumulated impairment losses. \\nThe cost of internally constructed plant and equipment com-\\nprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manufactur-\\ning process as well as an appropriate proportion of production-\\nrelated overheads. This includes production-related depreciation \\nand amortisation as well as an appropriate proportion of admin-\\nistrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in ac-\\nquisition or manufacturing cost unless they are directly attribut-\\nable to the asset. The carrying amount of items of depreciable  \\nproperty, plant and equipment is written down according to \\nscheduled usage-based depreciation – as a general rule on a \\nstraight-line basis – over the useful lives of the assets. Depreci-\\nation is recorded as an expense in the income statement. \\nThe following us eful lives are applied throughout the BMW \\nGroup: \\nin years   \\nFactory and office buildings, residential buildings, fixed \\ninstallations in buildings and outside facilities   8 to 50 \\nPlant and machinery  3 to 30 \\nOther facilities, factory and office equipment  2 to 25 \\n    \\nThe useful life of the plant and equipment is reviewed regularly \\nand extended or shortened as necessary. This review also takes \\naccount of the impact of climate-related aspects on useful lives, \\nfor example due to changes in demand patterns or regulatory re-\\nquirements. This assessment is based on the assumptions used \\nfor long-term corporate planning purposes and product -related \\ndecisions, as described above. Climate-related aspects have an \\nindirect impact on the utilisation of property, plant and equip-\\nment. Adjustments to the useful lives of items of plant and ma-\\nchinery are avoided by a combination of flexible manufacturing \\narrangements (independent of drivetrain type and capable of \\nhandling all vehicle generations) and asset-preservation \\nmeasures. The useful lives of plant and machinery that are used \\nexclusively for internal combustion vehicle production are also \\ncovered by the most up-to-date planning assumptions. For ma-\\nchinery used in multiple -shift operations, depreciation rates are \\nincreased to account for the additional utilisation. If there is any \\nindication of impairment of property, plant and equipment, an im-\\npairment test is performed as described above for intangible as-\\nsets. '),\n",

Depending on the specific \\nfacts and circumstances of each individual case, power purchase \\nagreements and long-term supply contracts for battery cells may \\nalso constitute a lease.  \\nThe BMW Group recognises a right -of-use asset and a liability \\nfor the outstanding lease payments with effect from the date on \\nwhich the leased asset becomes available for use by the BMW \\nGroup. The cost of the right -of-use asset is the sum of the \\namount at which the lease liability is initially measured, any lease \\npayments made at or before the lease commencement date, any \\ninitial direct costs incurred by the lessee and the estimated costs \\nof dismantling, removing or restoring the leased asset. Lease in-\\ncentives granted by the lessor are deducted. Right-of-use assets \\nare depreciated on a straight -line basis over the shorter of the \\nuseful life of the leased asset and the expected lease term. If \\nownership of the leased asset is automatically transferred at the \\nend of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is re-\\nflected in the lease payments, the right-of-use asset is depreci-\\nated on a straight -line basis over the expected usef ul life of the \\nleased asset. Right -of-use assets are reported in the balance \\nsheet within the relevant line items for property, plant and equip-\\nment. The depreciation expense on right-of-use assets is re-\\nported in the income statement in cost of sales as well as in sell-\\ning and administrative expenses. \\nThe lease liability is measured on initial recognition at the present \\nvalue of the future lease payments. Subsequent to initial recog-\\nnition, the carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to \\nreflect interest on the lease liability and reduced, without income \\nstatement impact, by the lease payments made. Lease liabilities \\nare reported within financial liabilities, while interest expense is \\nreported as part of net interest result. In the cash flow statement, \\nboth the repayment portion and the interest portion of lease pay-\\nments are shown as cash outflows from financing activities. \\nThe lease payments to be taken into account to measure the \\nright-of-use asset and the lease liability comprise fixed pay-\\nments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or an \\ninterest rate as well as amounts expected to be payable under \\nresidual value guarantees. If it is reasonably certain that a pur-\\nchase or lease extension option will be exercised, the relevant \\npayments are also included. Payments for periods for which the \\nlessee has an option to terminate a lease unilaterally are only in-\\ncluded in the lease payments if it is reasonably certain that the \\ntermination option will not be exercised. For the purposes of as-\\nsessing options, the BMW Group takes account of all facts and \\ncircumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or \\nnot to exercise the option. \\nIFRS 16 requires that lease payments are discounted as a gen-\\neral rule using the interest rate implicit in the le ase. However, \\nsince the interest rate in leases entered into by the BMW Group \\ncannot readily be determined, amounts are discounted on the \\nbasis of the incremental borrowing rate. \\nThe incremental borrowing rate comprises the risk -free interest \\nrate in the relevant currency for matching maturities plus a pre-\\nmium for the credit risk. Specific risks attached to an asset are \\ngenerally not taken into account, given that collateral received in \\nthe context of alternative financing arrangements is not relevant \\nwithin the BMW Group. \\nDetermining which items are to be counted as lease payments – \\nincluding the issue of the lease term underlying those payments \\n– and which discount rate to apply involves using estimates and \\nassumptions that may differ from actual outcomes. \\nAs lessee, the BMW Group makes use of the application exemp-\\ntions available for short-term leases and leases of low -value  \\nassets. \\nGroup products recognised by BMW Group entities as leased \\nproducts under operating leases are measured at manufactur-\\ning cost and all other leased products at acquisition cost, in each \\ncase including initial direct costs. All leased products are depre-\\nciated over the period of the lease using the straight-line method \\ndown to their expected residual value. \\nWhere the recoverable amount of a lease exceeds the asset’s \\ncarrying amount, changes in residual value expectations are rec-\\nognised by adjusting scheduled depreciation prospectively over \\nthe remaining term of the lease. If the recoverable amount is \\nlower than the asset ’s carrying amount, an impairment loss is \\nrecognised for the shortfall. A test is carried out at each balance \\nsheet date to determine whether an impairment loss recognised \\nin prior years no longer exists or has decreased. In such cases, \\nthe carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable \\namount, at a maximum up to the amount of the asset’s amor-\\ntised cost. \\nAssumptions and estimations are required regarding future re-\\nsidual values, since these represent a significant part of future \\ncash inflows. Relevant factors to be considered include the trend \\nin market prices and demand on the pre-owned automobile mar-\\nket. The expected change in the drive-system mix going forward, \\nwhich is subject to regular analysis, is also taken into account. \\nThe BMW Group has developed and implemented methods and \\nprocesses that enable sustainability aspects of residual value \\nrisks, particularly climate-related aspects, to be appropriately as-\\nsessed and managed. A scenario -based approach is applied to \\nquantify the impact of the transition towards zero-emissions mo-\\nbility and factor in the technological progress of the products in-\\nvolved, resulting potentially in the need to adjust the estimated \\nresidual values of both internal combustion and electrified vehi-\\ncles. However, the transition to new drive systems will stretch \\nover a period of time. Under these circumstances, regulatory as-\\npects, customer behaviour and the structure of the product range \\nall have to be taken into account. To varying degrees, the afore-\\nmentioned aspects will play a role in bringing about changes to \\nthe existing product portfolio over the coming years. The nature \\nof these planned changes can already be anticipated today to \\nsome extent, highlighting potential but calculable risks for future \\noperations. Disproportionate risks can only arise in the  '),\n",

In addition to these various considera-\\ntions, the vehicle portfolio subject to residual value risks is re-\\nmeasured on a quarterly basis, allowing new aspects to be incor-\\nporated in the valuation at an early stage. In this case, valuations \\nrelevant for new business which are subject to the same turn of \\nevents would also be adjusted. The forecasting models used by \\nthe BMW Group are subject to regular review and can be supple-\\nmented where appropriate to include aspects relating to changes \\nin the market. \\nUsing this approach, upward or downward adjustments can be \\nmade to the forecast value on the basis of a range of scenario \\nanalyses. The assumptions are based on internally available his-\\ntorical data and current market data as well as on forecasts of \\nexternal institutions. Furthermore, assumptions are regularly val-\\nidated by comparison with external data. Certain types of con-\\ntracts require a high degree of judgement when deciding whether \\nthey give rise to operating leases or receivables from sales  \\nfinancing. \\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method  are \\nmeasured – provided no impairment has b een recognised – at \\ncost of investment adjusted for the Group’s share of earnings \\nand changes in equity capital. If there is any indication that an \\ninvestment is impaired, an impairment test is performed on the \\nbasis of the discounted cash flow method. An indicator exists, for \\nexample, in the event of a serious shortfall compared to budget, \\nthe loss of an active market or if funds are required to avoid \\ninsolvency. \\nWith the exception of lease receivables financial assets are \\nmeasured on initial recognition at their fair value. Financial as-\\nsets include, in particular, other investments, receivables from \\nsales financing, finance-related receivables , trade receivables  \\nand cash and cash equivalents. As a general rule, initial recogni-\\ntion takes place as soon as the BMW Group becomes a party to \\na contract. In the case of so- called “regular way” purchases or \\nsales of non -derivative financial assets, initial recognition takes \\nplace at the settlement date. Financial assets are derecognised \\nwhen contractual cash flows attached to them have expired or \\nare transferred and all significant risks and rewards have been \\npassed on to the acquirer. \\nDepending on the business model and the structure of contrac-\\ntual cash flows, financial assets are classified as measured at \\namortised cost, at fair value through comprehensive income or at \\nfair value through profit or loss. The category “measured at fair \\nvalue through comprehensive income” at the BMW Group com-\\nprises mainly marketable securities and investment funds used \\nfor liquidity management purposes. In the BMW Group, selected \\nmarketable securities, shares in investment funds, money mar-\\nket funds and convertible bonds are measured at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss, as their contractual cash flows do not solely \\nrepresent payments of principal and interest. \\nThe BMW Group does not make use of the option to measure \\nequity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive in-\\ncome or debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss. \\nThe market values of financial instruments meas ured at fair \\nvalue are determined on the basis of market information avail -\\nable at the balance sheet date, such as quoted prices or using \\nappropriate measurement methods, in particular the discounted \\ncash flow method. \\nItems reported under other investments  within the scope of \\nIFRS 9 are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Invest-\\nments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated com-\\npanies that are not material to the BMW Group are also included \\nin other investments. \\nReceivables from sales f inancing are measured as a general \\nrule at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  \\nAs part of its asset -backed securities (ABS) financing activities, \\nthe BMW Group transfers some of its receivables from sales fi-\\nnancing – primarily retail customer and dealership financing re-\\nceivables – to structured companies, which in turn securitise \\nthem and place them on the capital market as collateralised  \\nsecurities. \\nThe transferred receivables are not derecognised and therefore \\nremain on the BMW Group’s balance sheet. For this reason, re-\\nceivables from sales financing fulfil the criteria of the ”hold” busi-\\nness model. \\nReceivables from sales financing also include finance lease re-\\nceivables which are measured at the amount of the net invest-\\nment in the lease. This balance sheet line item also includes op-\\nerating lease receivables at the end of the reporting period. The \\nrelated vehicles are reported within the line item “Leased  \\nproducts”. \\nWith the exception of receivables from operating leases and \\ntrade receivables, the BMW Group applies the general approach \\ndescribed in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of financial assets. \\nUnder the general approach, loss allowances are measured on \\ninitial recognition on the basis of the expected 12-month credit \\nloss (stage 1). If the credit loss risk at the end of the reporting \\nperiod has increased significantly since initial recognition, the im-\\npairment allowance is measured on the basis of lifetime ex-\\npected credit losses (stage 2 – general approach). The measure-\\nment of the change in default risk is based on a comparison of \\nthe default risk at the date of initial recognition and at the end of \\nthe reporting period. The default risk at the end of each reporting \\nperiod is determined on the basis of credit checks, current key \\nperformance indicators and any overdue payments. '),\n",

For the purposes of \\nallocating an item to stage 2, it is irrelevant whether the credit \\nrisk of the assets concerned has increased significantly since in-\\nitial recognition. \\nAs a general rule, the BMW Group assumes that a receivable is \\nin default if it is more than 90 days overdue or if there are objec-\\ntive indications of insolvency, such as the opening of insolvency \\nproceedings. Credit-impaired assets are identified as such on the \\nbasis of this definition of default. In the case of credit -impaired \\nassets which had not been credit-impaired at the time they were \\nacquired or originated, an impairment allowance is recognised at \\nan amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (stage 3). This \\nis the case regardless of whether the general or simplified ap-\\nproach is applied. In the case of stage 3 assets, interest income \\nis calculated on the asset’s carrying amount less any impairment \\nloss. \\nIn addition, post-model adjustments are recorded if the risk is not \\nfully covered by the standard models.  \\nThe BMW Group derecognises financial assets when it has no \\nreasonable expectation of recovery. This may be the case, for in-\\nstance, if the debtor is deemed not to have sufficient assets or \\nother sources of income to service the debt.  \\nLoss allowances relating to the balance sheet line item “Receiv-\\nables from sales financing” are determined primarily on the basis \\nof past experience with credit losses, current data on overdue re-\\nceivables, rating classes and scoring information.  \\nForward-looking information (for instance for ecasts of key per-\\nformance indicators) is also taken into account if, based on past \\nexperience, such indicators show a substantive correlation to ac-\\ntual credit losses. \\nLoss allowances on trade receivables are determined primarily \\non the basis of information relating to overdue amounts. Further-\\nmore, both positive and negative economic scenarios are used \\nalongside the latest forecasts of key performance indicators \\nwhen determining the level of valuation allowances. These sce-\\nnarios are based on local analyses and take into account, for ex-\\nample, anticipated political and economic developments.  \\nInput factors available on the market, such as ratings and prob-\\nabilities of default, are used to calculate valuation allowances for \\ncash and cash equivalents, financial assets, receivables from \\nsubsidiaries and receivables from companies in which an invest-\\nment is held. In the case of marketable securities and investment \\nfunds, the BMW Group usually applies the option not to allocate \\nfinancial assets with a low default risk to different stages. Accord-\\ningly, assets with an investment grade rating are always allo-\\ncated to stage 1. \\nFinancial assets include in particular marketable securities and \\nshares in investment funds as well as derivative financial instru-\\nments. \\nDerivative fi nancial instruments  are used within the BMW \\nGroup for hedging purposes in order to reduce currency, interest \\nrate, fair value and market price risks. Derivative financial instru-\\nments are recognised as of the trade date, measured at their fair \\nvalue. Depending on their market value at measurement date, \\nthese financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet line \\nitems “Financial assets” or “Financial liabilities”. \\nFair values are determined on the basis of valuation models. Ob-\\nservable market price, tenor and currency basis spreads are \\ntaken into account in the measurement of derivative financial in-\\nstruments. Furthermore, the Group’s own credit risk and that of \\ncounterparties is taken into account on the basis of credit default \\nswap values for market contracts with matching terms. \\nThe BMW Group applies the option to recognise the credit risks \\narising from the fair values of a group of derivative financial as-\\nsets and liabilities on the basis of their total net amount. Portfo-\\nlio-based valuation adjustments (credit valuation adjustments \\nand debit valuation adjustments) to the individual derivative fi-\\nnancial assets and financial liabilities are allocated using the rel-\\native fair value approach (net method). \\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, changes in fair value of de-\\nrivative financial instruments are presented as part of other fi-\\nnancial result in the income statement or within other compre-\\nhensive income as a component of accumulated other equity, \\ndepending on whether the hedging relationship is classified as a \\nfair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. \\nFair value hedges are mainly used to hedge interest rate risks \\nrelating to financial liabilities. The currency basis is not desig-\\nnated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of cross cur-\\nrency interest rate hedges accounted for as fair value hedges. \\nAccordingly, changes in the market value of such components \\nare recorded as costs of hedging within accumulated other eq-\\nuity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to other fi-\\nnancial result within the income statement over the term of the \\nhedging relationship. \\nIn addition, for selected fixed-interest assets, a portion of the in-\\nterest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis in accordance with  '),\n",

The designated hedged items (underlying transactions) \\nare reported in the balance sheet as receivables from sales fi-\\nnancing or financial liabilities. Interest rate risks are hedged on \\nthe basis of the present value of net cash flows relating to fixed \\nincome assets (on the asset side) less cash flows relating to vari-\\nable-rate financing (on the liabilities side). The net cash flow de-\\ntermined in this way is hedged by purchasing corresponding in-\\nterest rate swaps that have the effect of reducing the interest rate \\nrisk. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a \\nmonthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking \\naccount of the constantly changing content of each portfolio. \\nFair value hedge ineffectiveness is generally recognised in other \\nfinancial result. \\nThe time values of option transactions and the interest compo-\\nnent – including the currency basis – of forward currency con-\\ntracts are not designated as part of the hedging relationship in \\nthe case of currency hedges accounted for as cash flow hedges. \\nChanges in the fair value of such components are recorded as \\ncosts of hedging on a separate line within accumulated other  \\nequity. Amounts recorded in accumulated other equity from cur-\\nrency hedges are reclassified to cost of sales when the related \\nhedged item is recognised in profit or loss. \\nIn the case of raw materials hedges that are accounted for as \\ncash flow hedges, the hedging instruments are designated in full \\nas part of the hedging relationship. Amounts recorded in accu-\\nmulated other equity are included in the carrying amount of in-\\nventories on initial recognition. Ineffectiveness arising on cash \\nflow hedges is recognised directly in cost of sales, whereas the \\nimpact of prematurely terminated hedging relationships is recog-\\nnised in other operating income and expenses. \\nDeferred income taxes are recognised for all temporary differ-\\nences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and lia-\\nbilities, including differences arising on consolidation procedures, \\nas well as on unused tax losses and unused tax credits, when it \\nis probable that they can be utilised. As an exception to this, de-\\nferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the implementation \\nof the Pillar Two rules are not recognised. Further information is \\nprovided in ↗ note 5. \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates \\nthat are expected to apply to the period when the asset is real-\\nised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that \\nhave been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet \\ndate. \\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed at each bal-\\nance sheet date on the basis of planned taxable income in future \\nfinancial years. If with a probability of more than 50% future tax \\nbenefits will not be realised, either in part or in total, a valuation \\nallowance is recognised on the deferred tax assets. The calcula-\\ntion of deferred tax assets requires assumptions to be made with \\nregard to the level of future taxable income and the timing of re-\\ncovery of deferred tax assets. These assumptions take account \\nof forecast operating results, announced legislative changes in \\nconnection with climate change and the impact on earnings of \\nthe reversal of taxable temporary differences. Since future busi-\\nness developments cannot be predicted with certainty and to \\nsome extent cannot be influenced by the BMW Group, the meas-\\nurement of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty.  \\nDeferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising \\nfrom investments in subsidiaries, branches and associated com-\\npanies as well as interests in joint arrangements are not recog-\\nnised if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal and \\nit is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the \\nforeseeable future. This is particularly the case if it is intended \\nthat profits will not be distributed, but rather will be used to main-\\ntain the substance and expand the volume of business of the en-\\ntities concerned. \\nCurrent income taxes are calculated within the BMW Group on \\nthe basis of tax legislation applicable in the relevant countries. To \\nthe extent that judgement was necessary to determine the treat-\\nment and amount of tax items presented in the financial state-\\nments, there is in principle a possibility that local tax authorities \\nmay take a different position. \\nAs a general rule, each income tax treatment is considered inde-\\npendently when accounting for uncertainties in income taxes . \\nIf it is not considered probable that an income tax treatment will \\nbe accepted by the local tax authorities, the BMW Group uses the \\nmost likely amount of the tax treatment when determining tax-\\nable profit and the tax base. \\nInventories of raw materials, supplies and goods for resale are \\ngenerally stated at the lower of average acquisition cost and net \\nrealisable value. \\nWork in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of \\nmanufacturing cost and net realisable value. Manufacturing cost \\ncomprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manu-\\nfacturing process as well as an appropriate proportion of produc-\\ntion-related overheads. This includes production-related depre-\\nciation and amortisation and an appropriate proportion of ad-\\nministrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in \\nthe acquisition or manufacturing cost of inventories. \\nInventories also include vehicles held for sale in the financial ser-\\nvices business, measured at their amortised cost or lower net re-\\nalisable value. \\nCash and cash equivalents comprise mainly cash on hand and \\ncash at bank with an original term of up to three months. With the \\nexception of money market funds, cash and cash equivalents are \\nmeasured at amortised cost. '),\n",

For these \\npurposes, transaction costs are taken into account except in the \\ncase of financial liabilities allocated to the category “measured at \\nfair value through profit or loss”. Subsequent to initial recognition, \\nliabilities are – with the exception of derivative financial instru-\\nments – measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nmethod. \\nProvisions for pensions are measured using the projected unit \\ncredit method. Under this method, not only obligations relating to \\nknown vested benefits at the reporting date are recognised, but \\nalso the effect of future expected increases in pensions and sal-\\naries. The calculation is based on independent actuarial valua-\\ntions which take into account the relevant biometric factors. \\nIn the case of funded plans, the pension obligation is offset \\nagainst plan assets measured at their fair value. If the plan as-\\nsets exceed the pension obligation, the surplus is tested for re-\\ncoverability. In the event that the BMW Group has a right of reim-\\nbursement or a right to reduce future contributions, it reports an \\nasset (within Other financial assets), measured on the basis of \\nthe present value of the future economic benefits attached to the \\nplan assets. For funded plans, in cases where the obligation ex-\\nceeds plan assets, a liability is recognised under pension provi-\\nsions. \\nThe calculation of the amount of the provision requires assump-\\ntions to be made with regard to discount rates, pension trends, \\nemployee fluctuation and the life expectancy of employees, \\namong other things. Discount rates are determined by reference \\nto market yields at the end of the reporting period on high-quality \\nfixed-interest corporate bonds. \\nNet interest expense on the net defined benefit liability or net in-\\nterest income on the net defined benefit assets are presented \\nseparately within the financial result. All other costs relating to \\nallocations to pension provisions are allocated to costs by func-\\ntion in the income statement. \\nPast service cost arises where a BMW Group company intro-\\nduces a defined benefit plan or changes the benefits payable un-\\nder an existing plan. This cost is recognised immediately in the \\nincome statement. Similarly, gains and losses arising on the set-\\ntlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised immediately in \\nthe income statement. \\nRemeasurement of the net liability can result from changes in the \\npresent value of the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of \\nthe plan assets or the asset ceiling. Remeasurement can result, \\namongst others, from changes in financial and demographic pa-\\nrameters, as well as changes following the portfolio develop-\\nment. Remeasurements are recognised immediately through \\nother comprehensive income and ultimately in equity (within rev-\\nenue reserves). \\nOther provisions are recognised when the BMW Group has a \\npresent legal or factual obligation towards a third p arty arising \\nfrom past events, the settlement of which is probable and when \\nthe amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provi-\\nsions with a remaining period of more than one year are meas-\\nured at their net present value. \\nThe measurement of provisions for  statutory and non -\\nstatutory warranty obligations (statutory, contractual and \\nvoluntary) involves estimations. In addition to manufacturer \\nwarranties prescribed by law, the BMW Group offers various fur-\\nther standard (assurance type) warranties depending on the \\nproduct and sales market. No provisions are recognised for ad-\\nditionally offered service packages that are treated as separate \\nperformance obligations. \\nProvisions for statutory and non-statutory warranties are recog-\\nnised at the point in time whe n control over the goods is trans-\\nferred to the dealership or retail customer or when it is decided \\nto introduce new warranty measures. With respect to the level of \\nthe provision, estimations are made in particular based on past \\nexperience of damage claims and processes. Future potential re-\\npair costs and price increases per product and market are also \\ntaken into account. Provisions for warranties for all companies of \\nthe BMW Group are adjusted regularly to take account of new \\ninformation, with the impact of any changes recognised in the in-\\ncome statement. Further information is provided in ↗ note 34. Sim-\\nilar estimates are also made in conjunction with the measure-\\nment of expected reimbursement claims. \\nThe recognition and measurement of provisions for  litigation \\nand liability risks  necessitate making assumptions in order to \\ndetermine the probability of liability, the amount of claim and the \\nduration of the legal dispute. The assumptions made, especially \\nthe assumption about the outcome of legal proceedings, are sub-\\nject to a high degree of uncertainty. The appropriateness of as-\\nsumptions is regularly reviewed, based on assessments under-\\ntaken both by management and external experts, such as law-\\nyers. If new developments arise in the future that result in a dif-\\nferent assessment, provisions are adjusted accordingly. \\nIf the recognition criteria relevant for provisions are not fulfilled \\nand the outflow of resources on fulfilment is not unlikely, the po-\\ntential obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability.

Under these rules, the BMW Group will be required pay a \\ntop-up tax to the extent that the Pillar Two specific tax rate in \\neach jurisdiction where it operates falls below the minimum rate \\nof 15%. The Pillar Two model rules have been implemented in \\nGermany with effect for financial years beginning after 31 De-\\ncember 2023. The BMW Group is therefore not subject to a Pillar \\nTwo tax expense for the financial year 2023. The impact of the \\nPillar Two model rules from the financial year 2024 onwards is \\ncurrently being assessed. For this purpose, the jurisdictions that \\ncould be affected by a top -up tax based on a preliminary Pillar \\nTwo calculation have been analysed for the BMW Group, taking \\ninto account the statutory temporary simplification rules (for so-\\ncalled “transitional safe harbours”). Based on the results of the \\nanalysis to date, the tax expense arising in the relevant jurisdic-\\ntions is estimated to be immaterial for the BMW Group. The BMW \\nGroup is already applying the exemption relating to the recogni-\\ntion of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with Pillar \\nTwo. Further information is provided in ↗ note 5. \\nDeferred taxes are determined on the basis of tax rates which \\nare currently applicable or expected to apply in the relevant na-\\ntional jurisdictions when the amounts are recovered.

This in-\\ncludes tax losses available for carryforward amounting to \\n€ 382 million (2022: € 416 million), on which a valuation allow-\\nance of €  129 million (2022: € 141 million) was recognised on \\nthe related deferred tax asset. Of these loss carryforwards, \\n€ 349 million ( 2022: €  382 million) can be used indefinitely, \\nwhile € 33 million (2022: € 34 million) expires after one to three \\nyears. \\nA net surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities \\namounting to € 95 million (2022: € 1,966 million) is reported for \\nentities that have suffered tax losses in the financial year 2023 \\nor the preceding year. The basis for the recognition o f deferred \\ntaxes is the BMW Group business model or management ’s as-\\nsessment that there is material evidence that the entities will \\ngenerate future taxable profit, against which deductible tempo-\\nrary differences can be offset.  \\nCapital losses available for carryforward in the UK which do not \\nrelate to ongoing operations decreased due to changes in con-\\nsolidated group companies and exchange rate factors and stood \\nat € 1,845 million (2022: € 1,856 million) at the end of the year \\nunder report. As in previous years, deferred tax assets recog-\\nnised on these tax losses amounting to € 461 million (2022: \\n€ 464 million) were fully written down since they can only be uti-\\nlised against future capital gains. \\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted for \\neach relevant tax entity if they relate to the same tax authorities. \\nThe change in deferred taxes relating to amounts recognised  \\nwith income effect or without income effect is shown in the fol-\\nlowing reconciliation: \\n   \\nThe effects in connection with the first -time consolidation of \\nBMW Brilliance in the previous year gave rise primarily to net de-\\nferred tax liabilities relating to the remeasurement of the assets \\nacquired and liabilities assumed as part of the purchase price  \\nallocation. \\nNo deferred taxes are recognised on taxable temporary differ-\\nences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associated com-\\npanies and joint ventures if the BMW Group is able determine the \\ntiming of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is prob-\\nable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the fore-\\nseeable future, in particular in view of the fact that there is no in-\\ntention to distribute the profits, but rather to use them to maintain \\nsubstance and reinvest in the companies concerned. Temporary \\ndifferences of this kind, for which no deferred taxes were recog-\\nnised, amounted to € 36,081 million (2022: € 32,882 million). \\nNo computation was made of the potential impact of income \\ntaxes on the grounds of proportionality. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDeferred tax liabilities on expected dividends amounted to \\n€ 187 million (2022: € 199 million) and related primarily to divi-\\ndends from foreign subsidiaries. \\nThe tax returns of BMW Group entities are checked regularly by \\nGerman and foreign tax authorities.

Also included \\nare subsidies for tool costs, licences, purchased development \\nprojects, emissions allowances, software and purchased cus-\\ntomer bases. \\nOther intangible assets include brand-name rights amounting to \\n€ 96 million (2022: € 95 million) which are allocated to the Au-\\ntomotive segment and are not subject to scheduled amortisation \\nsince their useful life is deemed to be indefinite. The brand-name \\nrights are, to an extent, subject to a limited right of ownership . \\nIntangible assets also include goodwill of € 33 million \\n(2022: € 33 million) allocated to the Automotive excluding BMW \\nBrilliance cash -generating unit (CGU) and goodwill of \\n€ 1,107 million ( 2022: € 1,182 million) allocated to the BMW \\nBrilliance CGU. Goodwill amounting to € 347 million \\n(2022: € 347 million) related to the Financial Services CGU. \\nAs in the previous year, there was no requirement to recognise \\nimpairment losses or reversals of impairment losses on intan - \\ngible assets in 2023. \\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a \\ncost component of intangible assets in 2023. \\nIn 2023, government grants totalling € 2 million (2022: € 0 mil-\\nlion) were deducted from the acquisition cost of intangible assets \\nfor the first time. These grants include public sector funds aimed \\nat promoting development. \\n \\n \\n \\n22 Property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use \\nassets arising from leasing) \\nNo impairment losses were recognised in 2023, as in the previ-\\nous year. \\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a \\ncost component of property, plant and equipment in 2023. \\nRight-of-use assets arising from leases of land and buildings re-\\nlate primarily to logistics and office premises and, to a lesser ex-\\ntent, to selling and production premises. In order to secure these \\npremises and, in the interests of flexibility, the property rental \\nagreements concerned often contain extension and termination \\noptions. \\nIn 2023, government grants t otalling € 121 million (2022: \\n€ 0 million) were deducted from the acquisition cost of property, \\nplant and equipment for the first time. These amounts relate \\nmainly to public sector grants aimed at the promotion of regional \\nstructures as well as to subsidies received for plant expansions. \\nThe regular review of the useful lives of items of property, plant \\nand equipment subject to systematic depreciation takes into ac-\\ncount the assumptions contained in the long-term corporate \\nplan, and hence the ongoing transformation towards electric mo-\\nbility as well as the associated short- and medium-term impact \\non the product portfolio. The review of useful lives did not lead to \\nany material adjustments in the financial year 2023. \\n23 Leased products \\nMinimum lease payments of non -cancellable operating leases \\nfall due as follows: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nwithin one year  9,601  9,606 \\nbetween one and two years  6,872  6,522 \\nbetween two and three years  3,875  3,465 \\nbetween three and four years  1,813  1,512 \\nbetween four and five years  305  265 \\nlater than five years  52  38 \\nMinimum lease payments  22,518  21,408 \\n    \\nImpairment losses amounting to € 553 million ( 2022: \\n€ 527 million) were recognised on leased products in 2023 as a \\nconsequence of changes in residual value expectations. Income \\nfrom the reversal of impairment losses amounted to € 274 mil-\\nlion (2022: € 282 million). \\nIn 2023, public sector  grants totalling € 252 million \\n(2022: € 0 million) were deducted from the acquisition cost of \\nleased products for the first time. These amounts relate mainly \\nto investment tax credits in the form of tax credits for electric ve-\\nhicles. It is expected that the investment tax credits can be uti-\\nlised. The actual utilisation of investment tax credits will, how-\\never, depend on the extent to which they can be offset against \\nincome tax liabilities and is therefore subject to a degree of  \\nuncertainty.

Benefits granted by the \\ntwo plans are funded by a combination of the payment of fixed \\nmonthly contributions by the Company, a deferred remuneration \\noption for employees and a matching contribution by the Com-\\npany. Further contributions are made on the basis of the BMW \\nGroup’s performance. A further plan is in place that is funded en-\\ntirely out of deferred remuneration. Due to the minimum interest \\nrate guaranteed by the BMW Group, these plans are all classified \\nas defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19. In addition to \\nthe above plans, an employer-funded, defined benefit pension  \\nplan with lifelong pension benefits remains in place which is now \\nclosed to new entrants. The pension benefit is calculated by mul-\\ntiplying a fixed amount by the number of completed years of ser-\\nvice. Only employees who have not agreed to a one -time option \\nto switch to the defined contribution system will receive future in-\\ncreases in entitlements under this plan. \\nThe assets of the German pension plans are invested by BMW \\nTrust (a German association) in accordance with a CTA. The rep-\\nresentative bodies of the association are the Board of Directors \\nand the Members’ General Meeting. BMW Trust currently has \\nseven members and three members of the Board of Directors \\nelected by the Members’ General Meeting. The Board of Directors \\nis responsible for investments, drawing u p and deciding on in-\\nvestment guidelines as well as monitoring compliance with those \\nguidelines. The members of the association can be employees, \\nemployee representatives, senior executives and members of the \\nBoard of Management of BMW AG. An ordinary Members' Gen-\\neral Meeting takes place once every calendar year, and deals with \\na range of matters, including receiving and approving the associ-\\nation’s annual report, ratifying the activities of the Board of Direc-\\ntors and adopting changes to the association’s statutes. \\nUK \\nDefined benefit plans exist in the UK which are closed for all plan \\nparticipants. Vested benefits remain in place. New benefits are \\ncovered by contributions made to a defined contribution plan. \\nThe defined benefit pension plans are administered by BMW \\nPension Trustees Limited, Farnborough, and BMW (UK) Trustees \\nLimited, Farnborough, both trustee companies which act inde-\\npendently of the BMW Group. BMW (UK) Trustees Limited, Farn-\\nborough, is represented by ten trustees and BMW Pension Trus-\\ntees Limited, Farnborough, by five trustees. A minimum of one \\nthird of the trustees must be elected by plan participants. The \\ntrustees represent the interests of plan participants and decide \\non investment strategies. Funding contributions to the funds are \\ndetermined in agreement with the BMW Group. \"),\n",

The discount rates used to calculate pension ob-\\nligations are subject to market fluctuations and therefore influ-\\nence the level of the obligations. Furthermore, changes in other \\nactuarial parameters, such as expected rates of inflation, also \\nhave an impact on pension obligations. In order to reduce cur-\\nrency exposures, a substantial portion of plan assets is either in-\\nvested in the same currency as the underlying plan or hedged by \\nmeans of currency derivatives. As part of the internal reporting \\nprocedures and for internal management purposes, financial \\nrisks relating to the pension plans are reported using a value-at-\\nrisk approach by reference to the pension deficit. The investment \\nstrategy is also subject to regular review together with external \\nconsultants, with the aim of ensuring that investments are struc-\\ntured to match the timing of pension payments and the expected \\ndevelopment of pension obligations.

This assessment \\nmay change over time and is adjusted regularly on the basis of \\nnew information and circumstances. A part of the risks is covered \\nby insurance. \\nThe EU Commission’s antitrust proceedings were  settled on 8 \\nJuly 2021 (see ↗ note [10] to the BMW Group Financial State-\\nments for the financial year 2021 included in the BMW Group \\nReport 2021). \\nIn addition, respective antitrust proceedings were opened \\nagainst BMW AG by the Chinese State Administration for Market \\nRegulation in March 2019 and the Korea Fair Trade Commission \\nin May 2020. Possible risks for the BMW Group in connection \\nwith the antitrust proceedings in China cannot be currently fore-\\nseen, neither in terms of their outcome nor the amounts involved. \\n \\n \\n \\nIn April 2023, the South Korean antitrust authority imposed a \\nfine of approximately 13 billion South Korean won (approxi-\\nmately € 9 million). BMW AG will no longer take action against \\nthe authority’s decision. \\nIn relation to these allegations, numerous class action lawsuits \\nhave been brought in the USA and Canada in the second half of \\n2017, as well as several individual customers’ lawsuits in South \\nKorea in June 2018. In the USA, the customer class actions were \\nwithdrawn in August 2021 and the dealer class action was dis-\\nmissed in the final instance in June 2022. In Canada, the class \\naction lawsuits have been discontinued without any payments \\nmade by BMW. The individual customers’ lawsuits in South Ko-\\nrea remain at an early stage. Further civil lawsuits based on the \\nallegations are possible going forward. Further disclosures pur-\\nsuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present. \\nBeginning in 2014, regulatory authorities have ordered the BMW \\nGroup to recall various vehicle models in conjunction with airbags \\nsupplied by the Takata group of companies. Provision for the \\ncosts involved has been recognised within warranty provisions. \\nIn addition to the risks already covered by warranty provisions, it \\ncannot be ruled out that further vehicles of the BMW Group will \\nbe affected by future recall actions. Further disclosures pursuant \\nto IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present. \\nIn May 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \\n(NHTSA), an agency of the US federal government, requested a \\nrecall of airbags in the USA that are equipped with airbag inflat-\\nors produced by ARC Automotive. Further implications for the \\nBMW Group in other regions outside of North America as well as \\nimplications from class action lawsuits, which have been brought \\nin this context against the BMW Group in the USA, cannot be  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nestimated at present. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 \\ncannot be provided at present. \\nIn March 2022, the European Commission (EC) conducted in-\\nspections at the premises of automobile manufacturers and as-\\nsociations located in several member states. In parallel, the EC \\nsent out formal requests for information to several automobile \\nmanufacturers, including BMW AG. The inspections and re-\\nquests for information concern possible collusion in relation to \\nthe collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life vehicles and \\nlight commercial vehicles. The inspections were conducted in co-\\nordination with the UK Competition and Markets Authority, which \\nhas initiated formal proceedings in respect of the UK market. The \\ncompetition authorities allege that car manufacturers (i) coordi-\\nnated the remuneration to be paid to dismantlers for the provi-\\nsion of their services and (ii) agreed that issues related to end -\\nof-life vehicles should be dealt with in a non -competitive way. \\nAppropriate risk provisions were recognised in the second quar-\\nter 2022 in connection with these investigations. At the current \\nstage of the investigations, further risks for the BMW Group in \\nconnection with the proceedings of the two authorities cannot be \\nquantified at present. In December 2023, the South Korean anti-\\ntrust authority conducted an inspection at the premises of sev-\\neral car manufacturers, including BMW Korea. The investigation \\nby the South Korean antitrust authority has the same back-\\nground as the investigations of the European Commission and \\nthe UK Competition and Markets Authority. Due to the early stage \\nof this investigation, it is also not possible to provide further in-\\nformation in this regard.

Potential risks for the BMW \\nGroup cannot be quantified at the present time. Further disclo-\\nsures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present. \\nIn several recent judgements, the European Court of Justice has \\nruled on emission control systems in diesel vehicles and has sig-\\nnificantly tightened requirements pertaining to the justification of \\nthese systems. As a result of these new judgements by the Eu-\\nropean Court of Justice, the interpretation of regulatory require-\\nments for emission control systems is evolving. This is reflected, \\namongst other things, by the fact that established administrative \\npractices of type approval authorities are being questioned from \\nnumerous sides. This development leads to a reassessment of \\ncivil proceedings pending in Germany due to the emissions per-\\nformance of BMW and MINI diesel vehicles. According to previ-\\nously established case law of German national courts, damage \\nclaims could only be asserted on the basis of intentional damage \\ninflicted in a manner offending common decency. In its most re-\\ncent judgements linked to proceedings against other manufac-\\nturers and taking into account the case law of the European Court \\nof Justice, the German Federal Court of Justice has ruled that a \\nmanufacturer can also be held liable for negligent breach of EU \\nhomologation standards and on the basis of a far-reaching re-\\nversal of the burden of proof to the detriment of the manufac-\\nturer. An increase in the effort and complexity of the defence in \\nindividual cases, an increasing number of new court proceedings, \\nincreased legal risks and increased financial expenditure are to \\nbe expected. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot \\nbe provided at present.  \\nIn addition, the KBA determined in February 2024 that two func-\\ntionalities of the emission control system of the BMW vehicle \\nmodel X3 with 2.0 litre diesel engine (EU5), built between Sep-\\ntember 2010 and March 2014 do not comply with legal require-\\nments. The KBA views these functionalities as prohibited defeat \\ndevices. The BMW Group has filed a timely objection against this \\ndecision. Corrective measures are currently being coordinated \\nwith the responsible type approval authorities. Furthermore, the \\nBMW Group is investigating whether and to what extent function-\\nalities of the emission control systems of this and other past die-\\nsel vehicle models comply with legal requirements and is in dia-\\nlogue with the responsible authorities in this regard. Also, against \\nthe background of the development in case law referred to \\nabove, it is possible that further authorities and/or courts find \\nfault with functionalities of the emission control systems or deem \\nthem as non-compliant with legal requirements. Given that the \\ninvestigations will take some time, it is not  currently possible to \\nmake any disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 with regard to pos-\\nsible measures to be taken, possible effects on administrative \\nand civil court proceedings and any financial risks that may be \\nrelated thereto. \\nFurthermore, several BMW Group entities have been facing a \\nnumber of diesel emissions-related court claims in England and \\nWales since November 2021 as well as in Scotland since March \\n2023. In November 2023, the High Court approved a group liti-\\ngation regarding the proceeding in England and Wales. In De-\\ncember 2023, the court ordered that at least three out of the 16 \\npending court proceedings against OEMs will proceed to trial \\nfrom October 2024 onwards. The proceedings against two other \\nOEMs have already been selected, and the selection of other \\nOEM proceedings is expected to follow in March 2024. In Scot-\\nland, the court also approved the combination of relevant claims \\nin group proceedings. It is estimated that any sued BMW Group \\nentities will have to file their statement of defence in April 2024. \\nGiven that proceedings are still at an early stage, the probability, \\namount or timing of any liability cannot be determined at present. \\nFurther disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at \\npresent. \\nOther financial commitments \\nIn addition to liabilities, provisions and contingent liabilities, the \\nfollowing commitments exist for the BMW Group at the end of the \\nreporting period: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nPurchase commitments for property, plant \\nand equipment  7,712  5,758 \\nPurchase commitments for intangible assets   2,252  1,912 \\n    '),\n",

The valuation of unlisted equity \\ninstruments is determined primarily using the market-based ap-\\nproach. In particular, the financing rounds that take place within \\nthe private equity sector – usually on a regular basis at intervals \\nof approximately 12 to 24 months – represent a significant input \\nfactor for these purposes. In addition, the investment advisor \\nprovides the external fund manager with relevant, investment -\\nspecific information on an ongoing basis (at least quarterly). The \\nlatter subsequently assesses the underlying individual com - \\npanies in accordance with the guidelines for International Private \\nEquity and Venture Capital Valuations (IPEV). \\nAs part of the process of analysing valuations, the external fund \\nmanager reviews the investment -specific milestones, including \\nan analysis of financial, technical and liquidity -specific perfor-\\nmance indicators , among others. Based on this analysis, it is \\nconsidered whether the price of the most recent financing round \\nis accept-able as a reasonable market valuation, in particular for \\nearly-stage or growth -phase investments. Key performance in-\\ndicators used for the purpose of milestone analysis are depend-\\nent on the business model underlying the investment. Typical \\ntechnical key performance indicators relate to licenses and pa-\\ntents held, the stage of technology development such as evi-\\ndence of feasibility and prototypes, market entries, customer and \\nuser growth and appointments to key management positions. \\nKey financial performance indicators used are revenues, EBITDA \\nand the corresponding growth rate and/or development of \\nspecific contribution margins. Key liquidity -specific performance \\nindicators are cash on hand, cash burn rates and  prospects for \\nfuture financing rounds. \\nSince the pricing from the financing rounds is considered to be \\nthe decisive input factor for the valuation, increases and de-\\ncreases in valuation give rise to a similar change in the equity \\ninstrument that is recognised in the income statement. \\nIn addition, equity instruments that are held outside the private \\nequity fund are measured using the income approach. This in-\\nvolves discounting cash flows on the basis of current business \\ncases using the weighted average cost of capital to determine \\nthe fair value of the financial instrument. Changes in fair values \\ndetermined in connection with adjustments to significant input \\nfactors are not material for the BMW Group. \\nThe convertible bonds that have been classified to Level 3 are \\nprimarily used as instruments in advance of future financing \\nrounds relating to private equity investments. Valuations are \\ntherefore performed in accordance with the IPEV guidelines. \\nMandatory conversions are usually structured in such a way that \\nthe number of shares to be received depends on the future share \\nprice. Due to the generally short maturities, the instruments are \\nsubject to only insignificant fluctuations in value. Irrespective of \\nthis fact, impairment tests are performed at regular intervals. \\nThe fair value of the options that the BMW Group holds in shares \\nof such investee companies is measured primarily on the basis \\nof a binomial model, taking into account the respective conditions \\nunder which the options were granted. The comments provided \\non the income -based approach used to measure equity instru-\\nments held outside the private equity fund apply analogously for \\nthe purposes of determining the relevant entity value that is \\ntaken into account when measuring the fair value of the options. \\nThe exercise price for share options arising in conjunction with \\nthe private equity fund is generally low, verging towards zero. \\nConsequently, financing rounds have a direct impact on the fair \\nvalue of the options. In this respect, the valuation of options and \\nassessment of their impact on sensitivity is similar to the  \\napproach taken to unquoted equity instruments, as described \\nabove. '),\n",

Total interest ex-\\npenses arising on financial instruments measured at amortised \\ncost amounted to € 2.5 billion (2022: € 1.7 billion). \\n \\nCredit risk \\nThe BMW Group is exposed to counterparty credit risks if con-\\ntractual partners, for example a retail customer or a dealership, \\nare unable or only partially able to meet their contractual obliga-\\ntions. Information on the management of credit risk for receiv -\\nables from sales financing is provided in the Combined Manage-\\nment Report. (↗ Outlook and ↗ Risks and Opportunities) \\nNotwithstanding the existence of collateral accepted, the carry-\\ning amount of financial assets (with the exception of derivative \\nfinancial instruments) generally represents the maximum credit \\nrisk. In addition, the credit risk is increased by additional unu-\\ntilised loan commitments in the dealership financing line of busi-\\nness. Total dealership financing credit risk at the end of the re-\\nporting period therefore amounted to € 32,149 million ( 2022: \\n€ 31,163 million). \\nIn the case of all relationships underlying non-derivative financial \\ninstruments, in order to minimise the credit risk and depending \\non the nature and amount of exposure, collateral is required, \\ncredit information and references obtained or historical data \\nbased on the existing business relationship, in particular pay-\\nment behaviour, reviewed. \\nIn the case of trade receivables, customers are regularly as-\\nsessed with regard to their credit risk. Depending on contractual \\nstatus, necessary measures, such as dunning procedures, are  \\ninitiated in good time. \\nThe credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial \\ninstruments is minimised by the fact that the Group only enters \\ninto such contracts with parties of first-class credit standing. \\nWithin the financial services business, items financed for retail \\ncustomers and dealerships (such as vehicles, facilities and prop-\\nerty) serve as first-ranking collateral with a recoverable value.  \\nSecurity is also put up by customers in the form of collateral asset \\npledges, asset assignment and first-ranking mortgages, supple-\\nmented where appropriate by warranties and guarantees. Items \\npreviously held as collateral that are subsequently acquired re-\\nlate mainly to vehicles. As a rule, these assets can be converted \\ninto cash at short notice through the dealership organisation. \\nCreditworthiness testing is an important aspect of the BMW \\nGroup’s credit risk management. Every borrower’s creditworthi-\\nness is tested for all credit financing and lease contracts entered \\ninto by the BMW Group. In the case of retail customer financing, \\ncreditworthiness is assessed using validated scoring systems in-\\ntegrated in the purchasing process.  \\nIn the area of dealership financing, creditworthiness is assessed \\nby means of ongoing credit monitoring and an internal rating sys-\\ntem that takes account not only of the material credit standing of \\nthe borrower, but also of qualitative factors, such as past reliabil-\\nity in business relations. \\nThe credit risk on tra de receivables is assessed mainly on the \\nbasis of information relating to overdue amounts. The gross car-\\nrying amounts of these receivables are allocated in accordance \\nwith IFRS 9 to overdue ranges used for management purposes \\nas follows: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nNot overdue  3,718  3,871 \\n1–30 days overdue  339  208 \\n31–60 days overdue  42  31 \\n61–90 days overdue  29  11 \\nMore than 90 days overdue  104  65 \\nTotal  4,232  4,186 \\n    '),\n",

Derivative financial instruments are used to \\nreduce the risk remaining after netting. \\nCurrency, interest rate and raw materials market price risks of the \\nBMW Group are managed at a corporate level.  \\nFurther information is provided in the ↗ Outlook and ↗ Risks and \\nOpportunities sections of the Combined Management Report. \\nCurrency risk \\nAs an enterprise with worldwide operations, the BMW Group \\nconducts business in a variety of currencies, from which currency \\nrisks arise. In order to hedge currency risks, the BMW Group \\nholds, as at 31 December 2023, derivative financial instruments \\nmostly in the form of forward currency contracts and currency \\nswaps. \\nAs part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, \\nthe extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided \\nat regular intervals. The economic relationship between the \\nhedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on \\nthe fact that they are denominated in the same currency and \\nhave the same maturities. Items are hedged on the basis of a \\nconstant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk \\nexposure. \\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for \\ncounterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that \\nhave been established for credit risk management, ineffective-\\nness is not expected to arise. \\nThe BMW Group measures currency risk using a cash -flow-at-\\nrisk model. The analysis of currency risk is b ased on forecast \\nforeign currency transactions which could result in exposures to \\nsurpluses of foreign currency cash inflows and cash outflows. At \\nthe end of the reporting period, the overall currency exposure – \\nin each case for the following year and determined by aggregat-\\ning the individual currency exposures based on their absolute \\namount – was as follows: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nCurrency exposure  39,157  43,179 \\n   \\nCurrency exposures include short positions amounting to \\n€ 2,136 million (2022: € 3,604 million). \\nThe currency exposure is compared to all hedges that are in \\nplace. The net cash flow surplus represents an uncovered risk \\nposition. The cash-flow-at-risk approach involves showing the \\nimpact of potential exchange rate fluctuations on operating cash \\nflows on the basis of probability distributions. Volatilities and cor-\\nrelations serve as the main input factors to determine the rele-\\nvant probability distributions. \\nThe potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at the re-\\nporting date for each currency for the following financial year on \\nthe basis of current market prices and exposures with a confi-\\ndence level of 95%. The risk mitigating effect of correlations be-\\ntween the various currencies is taken into account when the risks \\nare aggregated. \\nThe following table shows the potential negative impact for the \\nBMW Group for the following year resulting from unfavourable \\nchanges in exchange rates, measured on the basis of the cash-\\nflow-at-risk approach. \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nCash flow at risk  493  530 \\n   \\nInterest rate risk \\nInterest rate risks arise when funds are borrowed and invested \\nwith differing fixed-rate periods or differing terms. At the BMW \\nGroup, all items subject to, or bearing, interest are exposed to \\ninterest rate risk and can therefore affect both the assets and li-\\nabilities side of the balance sheet.  \\nThe fair value of the Group’s interest rate portfolios was as fol-\\nlows at the end of the reporting period: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nFair values of interest rate portfolios   73,510  73,954 \\n    \\nInterest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate de-\\nrivatives. As part of the implementation of the risk management \\nstrategy, interest rate risks are monitored and managed at regu-\\nlar intervals. The interest rate contracts used for hedging pur-\\nposes comprise mainly swaps, which, if hedge accounting is ap-\\nplied, are accounted for as fair value hedges. The economic re-\\nlationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument \\nis based on the fact that the main parameters of the hedged item \\nand the related hedging instrument (e.g. start date, term and cur-\\nrency) are the same. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant \\nratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk expo-\\nsure. \\nIn view of the fact that own credit risk is excluded from the hedg-\\ning relationship, ineffectiveness is expected to be low. \\nFor selected fixed-interest assets, part of the interest rate risk is \\nhedged on a portfolio basis. In this case, swaps are used as the \\nhedging instrument. Hedge relationships are terminated and re-\\ndesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting pe-\\nriod, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content \\nof each portfolio. \\nIn light of the reform and replacement of certain benchmark in-\\nterest rates, some of the BMW Group’s hedging relation ships \\nhave been redesignated to take account of alternative bench-\\nmark interest rates.

The tasks of the conversion project includes the continual \\nmonitoring of regulatory developments, the initiation of neces-\\nsary changes to systems, processes, risk and measurement \\nmodels as well as the clarification of the associated accounting \\nand financial reporting implications. In the financial year 2023, \\nall contracts based on USD LIBOR were converted to alternative \\nbenchmark interest rates (€ 412 million). \\nIn the case of CAD CDOR and PLN WIBOR, uncertainty remains \\nas to the exact timing and nature of the changes. Non-derivative \\nfinancial instruments that have not been converted to an alterna-\\ntive interest rate at 31 December 2023 all relate to the CAD \\nCDOR, with a nominal liability amount of € 171 million \\n(2022: € 242 million). Derivative financial instruments that have \\nnot been converted to an alternative interest rate at 31  Decem-\\nber 2023 all relate to the PLN WIBOR, with a nominal amount of \\n€ 584 million (2022: € 100 million). \\nThe BMW Group applies a value-at-risk approach throughout the \\nGroup for internal reporting purposes and to manage interest \\nrate risk.  \\nThis approach is based on a historical simulation in which the \\npotential future fair value losses of the interest rate portfolios are \\ncompared across the Group with expected amounts on the basis \\nof a holding period of 250 days and a confidence level of \\n99.98%. The risk mitigating effect of correlations between the \\nvarious portfolios is taken into account when the risks are aggre-\\ngated. \\nIn the following table the potential volumes of fair value fluctu -\\nations – measured on the basis of the value -at-risk approach – \\nare compared with the expected value for the interest -rate-sen-\\nsitive exposures of the BMW Group: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nValue at risk  1,967  2,097 \\nRaw materials price risk \\nThe BMW Group is exposed to market price risks on raw mater -\\nials. In order to hedge these risks, the Group mainly uses forward \\ncommodity contracts. As part of the implementation of the risk \\nmanagement strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should \\nbe hedged is decided at regular intervals and the corresponding \\nhedging ratio defined. Items are hedged on the basis of a con-\\nstant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk \\nexposure. \\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for \\ncounterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that \\nhave been established for credit risk management, ineffective-\\nness is not expected to arise. \\nThe economic relationship between the hedged item and the \\nhedging instrument is based essentially on the fact that they \\nhave the same basis and term. The BMW Group designates only \\nthe commodity price index-linked raw materials surcharge, which \\nis specified in the purchase contracts of vehicle components , as \\na hedged item. The proportion of the hedged risk component as \\na percentage of the total fair value depends on the specific types \\nof vehicle component involved. Other price components con-\\ntained in the contract are not designated as being part of the \\nhedge relationship as no effective hedging instruments exist for \\nthese components. \\nThe starting point for analysing raw materials price risk is to iden-\\ntify planned purchases of raw materials or components contain-\\ning raw materials, the so-called “exposure”. At each reporting \\ndate, the exposure for the following financial year amounted to: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nRaw material price exposures  9,033  10,153 \\n    \\nThis exposure is compared to all hedges that are in place. The \\nnet cash flow surplus represents an uncovered risk position. The \\ncash-flow-at-risk approach involves showing the impact of po-\\ntential raw materials market price fluctuations on operating cash \\nflows on the basis of probability distributions. Volatilities and \\ncorrelations serve as input factors to assess the relevant proba-\\nbility distributions. \\nThe potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at the re-\\nporting date for each raw materials category for the following fi-\\nnancial year on the basis of current market prices and exposure \\nwith a confidence level of 95%. The risk mitigating effect of cor-\\nrelations between the various categories of raw materials is \\ntaken into account when the risks are aggregated. \\nThe following table shows the potential negative impact for the \\nBMW Group resulting from fluctuations in prices across all cate-\\ngories of raw materials, measured on the basis of the cash-flow-\\nat-risk approach. The risk at each reporting date for the following \\nfinancial year was as follows: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nCash flow at risk  1,045  1,115 \\n    '),\n",

The shares of com-\\nmon stock are purchased immediately after the personal cash in-\\nvestment amount has been paid out and are subject to a holding \\nperiod of four years from the date of purchase. The RoCE com-\\nponent and the strategic focus target component each make up \\nhalf of the target amount for the personal cash investment \\namount. For the RoCE component, a RoCE factor is determined \\nbased on the RoCE achieved in the Automotive segment for the \\ngrant year. For the strategic focus target component, a minimum \\nof two strategic focus targets are defined prior to the start of the \\nfinancial year. Minimum, target and maximum values are defined \\nand factors are assigned for the RoCE in the Automotive seg-\\nment and for each strategic focus target. The relevant factors are \\ndetermined after the end of the financial year based on the extent \\nto which targets were achieved. \\nFor financial years up to and including financial year 2020, \\nBoard of Management members received an earmarked cash \\namount (investment component) corresponding to 45% of the \\ngross amount of the bonus that, net of tax and deductions, had \\nto be invested in shares of the Company’s common stock (up to \\nand including financial year 2017, the investment component \\namounted to 20% of the total bonus after tax, which the Board \\nof Management members received plus tax and social security \\nas additional cash remuneration). This amount was also subject \\nto a four-year holding period and on expiry thereof the Board of \\nManagement members received one additional share of the \\nCompany’s common stock or the equivalent value in cash \\n(matching component) for every three shares of common stock \\nheld, at BMW AG’s discretion. \\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for early \\npayment of share-based remuneration components (matching \\ncomponents) based on the target amounts, and the holding pe-\\nriod is also dropped for shares of common stock that were ac-\\nquired with share -based remuneration components. Where the \\nservice contract is terminated prematurely and the Company has \\nan extraordinary right of termination, or if the Board member re-\\nsigns without the Company’s agreement, entitlements to \\namounts as yet unpaid relating to share -based remuneration \\n(matching components) are forfeited; a personal cash invest-\\nment amount will be settled based on the target amount.  \\nUp to and including financial year 2021, eligible senior depart-\\nment heads committed to invest 26% of their earnings-related \\nbonus in shares of BMW AG common stock and to hold the ac-\\nquired shares for four years. For the investment obligation, BMW \\nAG granted an amount corresponding to the entire investment \\namount as a net subsidy. \\nParticipants receive one additional share of common stock or the \\nequivalent value in cash for every three shares of common stock \\nheld once the four-year holding requirement has been fulfilled, at \\nthe Company’s discretion. \\nThe Board of Management members in office on the balance \\nsheet date hold 112,969 shares of BMW common stock with a \\nholding obligation arising from share-based remuneration for fi-\\nnancial years 2019 to 2022 (2022: 118,604).

The segmentation follows the internal \\nmanagement and reporting system and takes account of the or-\\nganisational structure of the BMW Group based on the various \\nproducts and services of the reportable segments. \\nThe activities of the BMW Group are broken down into the oper-\\nating segments Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services and \\nOther Entities. \\nWithin the Automotive segment, the BMW Group develops, man-\\nufactures, assembles and sells automobiles powered with all-\\nelectric drive systems, plug-in hybrid systems and highly efficient \\ncombustion engines, as well as spare parts, accessories and mo-\\nbility services under the BMW, MINI and Rolls- Royce brands. \\nBMW and MINI brand products are sold in Germany through \\nbranches of BMW AG and by independent, authorised dealer-\\nships. Sales outside Germany are handled mainly by subsidiary \\ncompanies and by independent import companies in some mar-\\nkets. Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are sold in selected markets via \\nsubsidiary companies and elsewhere by independent, authorised \\ndealerships. \\nActivities relating to the development, manufacture, assembly \\nand sale of motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories \\nare reported in the Motorcycles segment. \\nAutomobile and motorcycle leasing, retail and dealership financ-\\ning, multi-brand fleet business, customer deposit business and \\ninsurance activities are the main activities allocated to the Finan-\\ncial Services segment. \\nHolding and Group financing companies are reported in the Other \\nEntities segment. This segment also includes the operating com-\\npany Bavaria Lloyd Reisebüro GmbH, which is not allocated to \\none of the other segments. \\nInternal management and reporting \\nSegment information is prepared as a general rule in conformity \\nwith the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting \\nthe Group Financial Statements. Exceptions to this general prin-\\nciple include the treatment of inter-segment warranties, the earn-\\nings impact of which is allocated to the respective segments on \\nthe basis used internally to manage the business. In addition, in-\\ntragroup repurchase agreements between the Automotive and \\nFinancial Services segments pursuant to IFRS 15, impairment al-\\nlowances on intragroup receivables and changes in the value of \\nconsolidated other investments pursuant to IFRS 9 are also ex-\\ncluded. Intragroup leasing arrangements are not reflected in the \\ninternal management and reporting system on an IFRS 16 basis \\nand therefore, in accordance with IFRS 8, do not give rise to any \\nchanges in the presentation of segment information. Inter-seg-\\nment receivables and payables, provisions, income, expenses \\nand profits are eliminated upon consolidation. Inter-segment rev-\\nenues are based on market prices. Centralised cost components \\nare included in the respective segments, without resulting in cash \\nflows. \\nThe role of “chief operating decision maker” with respect to re-\\nsource allocation and performance assessment of the reportable \\nsegment is embodied in the full Board of Management. For this \\npurpose, different measures of segment performance as well as \\nsegment assets are taken into account in the operating \\nsegments. \\nThe Automotive and Motorcycles segments are managed on the \\nbasis of return on capital employed (RoCE). The relevant meas-\\nure of segment results used is therefore profit before financial re-\\nsult. Capital employed is the corresponding measure of segment \\nassets used to determine how to allocate resources. Capital em-\\nployed is calculated as the sum of intangible assets, property, \\nplant and equipment and net working capital, the latter compris-\\ning inventories as well as trade receivables less trade payables.  \\nFurther information is provided in the section “Managing oper -\\national performance at segment level” within the Combined Man-\\nagement Report. \\nThe success of the Financial Services segment is measured on \\nthe basis of return on equity (RoE). Profit before tax therefore rep-\\nresents the relevant measure of segment earnings. The measure \\nof segment assets in the Financial Services segment corresponds \\nto net assets, defined as total assets less total liabilities. \\nThe success of the Other Entities segment is assessed on the \\nbasis of profit or loss before tax. The corresp onding measure of \\nsegment assets used to manage the Other Entities segment is \\ntotal assets less asset -side income tax items and intragroup \\ninvestments.'),\n",

These matters were addressed in the \\ncontext of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as \\na whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not \\nprovide a separate audit opinion on these matters. \\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as \\nfollows: \\n1/ Measurement of leased products \\n2/ Valuation of receivables from sales financing \\n3/ Valuation of provisions for statutory and non -statutory \\nwarranty obligations as well as product guarantees \\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured \\nin each case as follows: \\n1/ Matter and issue  \\n2/ Audit approach and findings \\n3/ Reference to further information \\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters: \\n1/ Measurement of leased products \\n1/ The BMW Group leases vehicles to end customers under op-\\nerating leases (leased products). At the balance sheet date, the \\nfigure reported under the \"leased products\" line item for operat-\\ning leases was EUR 43,118 million (approximately 17.2% of \\ntotal assets). Leased products are measured at cost, which is \\ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to the \\nexpected residual value (recoverable amount). A key estimated \\nvalue for subsequent measurement of leased products is the \\nexpected residual value at the end of the lease term. For the re-\\nsidual value forecasts the BMW Group uses internally available \\ndata on historical empirical values, current market data and \\nmarket estimates as well as forecasts by external market re-\\nsearch institutes. The residual value estimates also contain reg-\\nulatory changes in the individual markets and expectations re-\\ngarding customer behavior, among others including climate pol-\\nicy considerations. The estimation of future residual values is \\nsubject to judgment due to the large number of assumptions to \\nbe made by the executive directors and the amount of data in-\\ncluded in the determination. \\nAgainst this background and due to the resulting significant un-\\ncertainties with regard to estimates in the context of measuring \\nthe residual values of the leased products, this matter was of \\nparticular significance in the context of our audit. \\n2/ As part of our audit we obtained an understanding of the de-\\nvelopment of operating leases, the underlying residual value \\nrisks as well as the business processes for the identification, \\nmanagement, monitoring and measurement of residual value \\nrisks, among other things by inquiries and inspection of docu-\\nments related to the internal calculation methods. Furthermore, \\nwe evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the in-\\nternal control system, particularly regarding the determination of \\nexpected residual values. This included the evaluation of the \\npropriety of the relevant IT systems as well as the implemented \\ninterfaces therein by our IT-specialists. In addition, we evaluated \\nthe appropriateness of the forecasting methods, the model as-\\nsumptions as well as the parameters used for the measurement \\nof the residual values based on the validations carried out by the \\nBMW Group. For this purpose, we inquired with the BMW \\nGroup\\'s experts responsible for the management and monitor-\\ning of residual value risks and inspected the internal analysis on \\nresidual value developments and residual value forecasts as \\nwell as the validation results. We examined the mathematical \\ncorrectness of the forecast values using the key calculation \\nsteps. \\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy our-\\nselves that the methods and processes for determining the ex-\\npected residual values of leased products underlying the \\nvaluation are appropriate and the assumptions and parameters \\nincluded in the forecast model for the residual value are appro-\\npriate as a whole. \\n3/ The Company\\'s disclosures on the applied \"Accounting poli-\\ncies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\" are contained in \\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 \\nand on leased products are contained under note 23. \\n2/ Valuation of receivables from sales financing \\n1/ The BMW Group offers end customers, dealerships and im-\\nporters various  financing models for vehicles. In this context, \\ncurrent and non-current receivables from sales financing total-\\ning EUR 87,355 million are reported in the consolidated state-\\nment of financial position as at the balance sheet date (approx-\\nimately 34.8% of total assets). Impairment losses amounting to \\nEUR 2,189 million were recognized on these receivables as at \\nthe balance sheet date. In order to determine the amount of the \\nnecessary valuation allowances to be recognized with respect \\nto receivables from sales financing, the BMW Group, among \\nothers, evaluates the creditworthiness of the dealers, importers \\nand end customers, as well as any loss ratios, and risk provi-\\nsioning parameters are derived based on historical default prob-\\nabilities and loss ratios. \\nThe determination of the valuation allowances by the executive \\ndirectors is subject to a significant degree of judgment due to \\nseveral value-influencing factors such as the estimation of cre-\\nditworthiness, the determination of probabilities of default and \\nloss ratios and was therefore of particular significance in the \\ncontext of our audit. \\n2/ As part of our audit we obtained a comprehensive under-\\nstanding of the development of receivables from sales financing, \\nthe associated default-related risks as well as the business pro-\\ncesses for the identification, management, monitoring and \\nmeasurement of default risks, among other things by inquiries \\nand inspection of documents on the internal calculation meth-\\nods. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effec-\\ntiveness of the internal control system regarding the determina-\\ntion of the impairment loss to be recognized. In this context, we '),\n",

As part of our au-\\ndit we assessed in particular the appropriateness of the risk \\nclassification procedures as well as the risk provisioning param-\\neters used. For this purpose, we analyzed in particular the vali-\\ndations of parameters that are regularly conducted by the Com-\\npany. To assess the default risk, we also used targeted sam-\\npling of individual cases to examine whether the attributes for \\nassignment to the respective risk categories were suitably avail-\\nable and the impairment losses had been calculated using the \\nparameters defined for these risk categories. \\nIn our view, the assumptions and parameters used in the meas-\\nurement of receivables from sales financing were appropriate \\noverall. \\n3/ The Company\\'s disclosures on the applied \"Accounting poli-\\ncies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\" are contained in \\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 \\nand on \"receivables from sales financing\" are contained under \\nnote 25. \\n3/ Valuation of provisions for statutory and non -statutory \\nwarranty obligations as well as product guarantees \\n1/ Provisions for statutory and non -statutory warranty obliga-\\ntions as well as product guarantees are included in the consoli-\\ndated financial statements of BMW Group as a material amount \\nin other provisions. The obligations amounted to EUR 9,650 \\nmillion (approximately 3.8% of total assets) as at 31 December \\n2023. The BMW Group is responsible for the legally required \\nwarranty and product guarantees in the respective sales market. \\nIn order to estimate the liabilities arising from statutory and non-\\nstatutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees for \\nvehicles sold, information on the type and volume of damages \\narising and on remedial measures is recorded and analyzed at \\nvehicle model level. The expected amount of obligations is ex-\\ntrapolated from costs of the past and recognized as a provision \\nin the corresponding amount, if the criteria of IAS 37 have been \\nmet. For specific or anticipated individual circumstances, for ex-\\nample recalls for vehicles sold, additional provisions are recog-\\nnized provided they have not already been taken into account.  \\nThe determination of provisions is associated with unavoidable \\nestimation uncertainties and is subject to a high risk of change, \\ndepending on factors such as notification of detected defects as \\nwell as claims made by vehicle owners. Against this background, \\nthis matter was of particular significance during our audit. \\n2/ In order to assess the appropriateness of the valuation \\nmethod used for the determination of the provisions for statu-\\ntory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product \\nguarantees including the assumptions and parameters, we pri-\\nmarily obtained an understanding of the process for determining \\nthe assumptions and parameters through discussions with the \\nresponsible employees of the BMW Group. We also evaluated \\nthe appropriateness as well as effectiveness of controls for de-\\ntermining the assumptions and parameters. With the involve-\\nment of our IT specialists, we checked the IT systems used re-\\ngarding their compliance. We compared the expenses for claims \\nand technical actions with actual costs incurred in order to draw \\nconclusions on the forecast accuracy. Based on a targeted sam-\\nple of vehicle models, the mathematical correctness of the valu-\\nation model used across the Group was examined. We exam-\\nined and evaluated the assumptions used by the BMW Group \\nconcerning the extent to which the past values were representa-\\ntive of the expected susceptibility of damage, the expected value \\nof damage per vehicle (comprising parts and labor input) as well \\nas the expected assertion of claims from statutory and non-stat-\\nutory warranties. \\nIn our view, the method for the valuation of provisions for statu-\\ntory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product \\nguarantees is overall appropriate. Taking into consideration the \\ninformation available, we believe that, overall, the measurement \\nparameters and assumptions used by the executive directors \\nare appropriate. \\n3/ The Company\\'s disclosures on the applied \"Accounting poli-\\ncies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\" are contained in \\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 \\nand on \"Other provisions\" are contained under note 34. \\nOther Information \\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other infor-\\nmation.

In addition the executive directors are re-\\nsponsible for such internal control as they have determined nec-\\nessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial state-\\nments that are free from material misstatement, whether due to \\nfraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of \\nassets) or error.  \\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the execu-\\ntive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to \\ncontinue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility \\nfor disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In \\naddition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on \\nthe going concern basis of accounting unless there is an inten-\\ntion to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no \\nrealistic alternative but to do so. \\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the \\npreparation of the group management report that, as a whole, \\nprovides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in \\nall material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial \\nstatements, complies with German legal requirements, and \\nappropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future de-\\nvelopment. In addition, the executive directors are responsible \\nfor such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have \\nconsidered necessary to enable the preparation of a group man-\\nagement report that is in accordance with the applicable Ger-\\nman legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient ap-\\npropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management \\nreport. \\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's \\nfinancial reporting process for the preparation of the consoli-\\ndated financial statements and of the group management re-\\nport. \\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements and of the Group Management Report \\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are \\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, \\nand whether the group management report as a whole provides \\nan appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material \\nrespects, is consistent with the consolidated financial state-\\nments and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with \\nthe German legal requirements and appropriately presents the \\nopportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue \\nan auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the con-\\nsolidated financial statements and on the group management \\nreport. \\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \\nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 \\nHGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with Ger-\\nman Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Au-\\ndits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will \\nalways detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can \\narise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individ-\\nually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of \\nthese consolidated financial statements and this group man-\\nagement report. \\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional \\nskepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of \\nthe consolidated financial statements and of the group \\nmanagement report, whether due to fraud or error, design \\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, \\nand obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate \\nto provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not \\ndetecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is \\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.  \\n— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the \\naudit of the consolidated financial statements and of \\narrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the \\naudit of the group management report in order to design \\naudit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, \\nbut not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on \\nthe effectiveness of these systems. \\n— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nby the executive directors and the reasonableness of \\nestimates made by the executive directors and related \\ndisclosures. \\n— Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' \\nuse of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on \\nthe audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty \\nexists related to events or conditions that may cast \\nsignificant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a \\ngoing concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty \\nexists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's \\nreport to the related disclosures in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements and in the group management report \\nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our \\nrespective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the \\naudit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's \\nreport.

In view of the fact that indi-\\nvidual members of the Board of Management also received re-\\nmuneration components from the remuneration system in effect \\nin the 2018 financial year during the 2023 financial year, ele-\\nments of these systems are also explained to the extent neces-\\nsary for comprehension. \\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesell-\\nschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has audited the Re-\\nmuneration Report beyond the requirements of § 162 (3) Sen-\\ntences 1 and 2  AktG. The Auditor’s Report is attached to this \\nreport. \\nI. REVIEW OF THE 2023 FINANCIAL YEAR\\nFROM A REMUNERATION PERSPECTIVE\\nThe 2023 financial year was very successful for the BMW Group. \\nA total of 2,554,183 vehicles were delivered – a new record for \\nthe BMW Group. The BMW brand defended its leading position \\nin the global premium segment by selling just under 2.3 million \\ndelivered vehicles. The Rolls-Royce brand also achieved record \\nsales. BMW Motorrad achieved the strongest sales in the Com-\\npany’s history in the year of its 100th anniversary. \\n1 For reasons of simplicity, this report partially uses the masculine form in reference to persons. It is \\nintended to represent all genders. \\n2 Due to rounding, it is possible that individual figures in this report may not add up exactly to the \\ntotals provided, and that the percentages presented here may not be an exact reflection of the \\nabsolute values to which they relate. \\nREMUNERATION REPORT  '),\n",

Outlook for the 2024 Financial Year\\nThe BMW Group generated a strong profit in the 2023 financial \\nyear. Group net profit amounted to € 12.2 billion, with € 11.3 bil-\\nlion attributable to BMW AG shareholders, while the Group return \\non sales after tax amounted to 7.8%. Under the leadership of the \\nBoard of Management, the Company continued to drive the \\nBMW Group’s transformation to electromobility forward in the re-\\nporting year. The BMW Group increased its sales of all -electric \\nve-hicles at a significantly greater pace than the market as a \\nwhole and has an all- electric offering in every major segment. \\nThe proportion of total sales attributable to all -electric vehicles \\nwent up to around 15%. \\nThe current remuneration system for the members of the Board \\nof Management came into effect on 1 January 2021. The Annual \\nGeneral Meeting approved it on 12 May 2021 with a majority of \\n91.60% of the valid votes cast. The Supervisory Board did not \\nresolve any changes to the remuneration system or the target \\nremuneration in the remuneration levels set out for the members \\nof the Board of Management in the 2023 financial year. \\nIn December 2022, the Supervisory Board set ambitious targets \\nlinked to the variable remuneration of the members of the Board \\nof Management for the 2023 financial year. Of the total variable \\ntarget remuneration available, around 39% was linked to envi-\\nronmental, social or governance (ESG) targets. The Supervisory \\nBoard has set ambitious targets to reduce fleet carbon emissions \\nin the EU and to increase all-electric vehicle sales. These serve \\nas strategic focus targets that correspond to 50% of the long -\\nterm variable remuneration (share -based remuneration). The \\nSupervisory Board has thus once again incorporated the strate-\\ngic importance of accelerating the electrification of the vehicle \\nfleet into the remuneration for the members of the Board of Man-\\nagement. The Supervisory Board placed particular emphasis on \\nenvironmental sustainability targets, which make up 50% of the \\nlong-term variable remuneration. \\nThanks to its strong overall performance, the Board of Manage-\\nment exceeded both the financial and a large part of the non-\\nfinancial targets for short-term variable remuneration (bonuses) \\nfor the 2023 financial year. ↗ Bonus for the 2023 financial year The fi-\\nnancial target tied to RoCE in the Automotive segment which \\nmakes up part of the long- term variable remuneration (share -\\nbased remuneration) component was also exceeded. In terms of \\nthe non-financial strategic focus targets for the long -term vari-\\nable remuneration, the ambitious targets related to the reduction \\nof fleet carbon emissions in the EU were exceeded, while the \\nBMW Group’s sales targets for all-electric vehicles were not quite \\nmet in full. ↗ Share-based remuneration for the financial year 2023 \\nIf necessary, and in the interest of the long -term success of \\nBMW\\u2006AG, the Supervisory Board may temporarily deviate from \\nthe remuneration system – as provided for in §\\u200987a (2) Sentence \\n2 AktG. In accordance with G.11 of the German Corporate Gov-\\nernance Code dated 28 April 2022 (“GCGC”), the Supervisory \\nBoard has also reserved the right to make adjustments if extraor-\\ndinary developments occur, such as significant acquisitions and \\ndisposals, or changes in accounting standards or tax regulations \\nthat have a significant impact. After due examination, it did not \\nmake use of these options for the 2023 financial year. \\nThe composition of the Board of Management changed during \\nthe 2023 financial year. Mr Pieter Nota left the Board of Man-\\nagement on 31 October 2023 by mutual agreement as part of a \\nsuccession arrangement. Dr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Man-\\nagement on 11 May 2023. This was also by mutual agreement \\nas part of a succession arrangement.  ↗ Premature termination of \\nactivities and post-contractual non-competition clause Mr Walter Mertl was \\nappointed as the member of the Board of Management respon-\\nsible for Finance on 12 May 2023. Mr Jochen Goller was ap-\\npointed as the member of the Board of Management responsible \\nfor Customer, Brands, Sales on 1 November 2023. From the \\nstart date of his second period of office on 1 July 2023, Mr Frank \\nWeber was eligible to receive the target remuneration in the sec-\\nond remuneration level, which is available to members of the \\nBoard of Management from their second period of office. \\nThe remuneration system for the members of the Supervisory \\nBoard is set out in Article 16 of the Articles of Incorporation and \\nprovides only for fixed remuneration. It was confirmed by the An-\\nnual General Meeting on 12 May 2021 with a majority of \\n99.40% of the valid votes cast, and implemented for the 2023 \\nfinancial year in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of \\nIncorporation. In the 2023 financial year, Dr Martin Kimmich was \\nappointed by the court to replace Mr Manfred Schoch as a mem-\\nber of the Supervisory Board on 18 January 2023. Mr Schoch left \\nthe Supervisory Board on 31 December 2022. On 23 January \\n2023, Dr Kimmich was appointed as the first deputy chair by the \\nSupervisory Board and as a member of the Personnel and Audit \\nCommittee. As the first deputy chair, he is also a member of the \\nPresiding Board and the legally required Mediation Committee. \\nApart from this, the composition of the Personnel Committee, \\nwhich is responsible for the preparation of remuneration deci-\\nsions in accordance with the Supervisory Board’s rules of proce-\\ndure, did not change in the 2023 financial year. The Supervisory \\nBoard awarded a contract to new external remuneration consult-\\nants in the 2023 financial year. The Remuneration Report for the \\n2022 financial year was confirmed by the Annual General Meet-\\ning on 11 May 2023 with a majority of 94.14% of the valid votes \\ncast. In view of the high level of approval, there was no reason to \\nrethink the implementation of the current remuneration system \\nor the manner of reporting. Changes were made to make certain \\nissues clearer. \\nII. OUTLOOK FOR THE\\n2024 FINANCIAL YEAR\\nThe remuneration system and the target remuneration for the \\nremuneration levels of  the members of the Board of Manage-\\nment, as described in this report for the 2023 financial year, will \\ncontinue to apply unchanged in the 2024 financial year. In De-\\ncember 2023, the Supervisory Board set the targets for variable \\nremuneration for the 2024 financial year on the basis of a pro-\\nposal by the Personnel Committee. A resolution was passed to \\nraise the required level of performance for the earnings compo-\\nnent of the bonus for the Board of Management, which remains \\nlimited to 180% of the target remuneration.  \\nThere are no plans to change the remuneration system for mem-\\nbers of the Supervisory Board for the 2024 financial year.

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management \\nIII. REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS\\nOF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\\n1. Principles of the remuneration system and the contribution of \\nremuneration to the promotion of the Company’s business \\nstrategy and its long-term development \\nThe remuneration system which has been in place since the \\n2021 financial year complies with the pro visions of the German \\nStock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations and \\nsuggestions of the GCGC. The Supervisory Board has applied the \\nfollowing principles in designing the remuneration system for the \\nBoard of Management: \\n— The remuneration structure is geared towards the \\nsustainable and long -term development of the Company. \\nTherefore, variable remuneration components are pre -\\ndominantly granted on the basis of a multi-year \\nassessment. \\n— The total remuneration of the members of the Board of \\nManagement is commensurate with their tasks and \\nperformance as well as the Company’s situation. \\n— The remuneration system ensures that both positive and \\nnegative developments are appropriately reflected in the \\nremuneration (“pay for performance”). \\n— The remuneration system takes into account both the \\nperformance of the entire Board of Management and the \\nachievement of individual targets. \\n— The remuneration system observes the principle of \\nconsistency between the remuneration systems in the \\nCompany: the remuneration systems for the Board of \\nManagement, executives and employees of BMW AG are all \\ndesigned in a similar way. \\n— The total remuneration is in line with market practice both in \\nterms of amount and structure, and takes into account the \\nsize, complexity and economic situation of the Company. \\nThe BMW\\u202fGroup aims to be the most successful and sustainable \\npremium provider of individual mobility. The business strategy \\nfocuses on the customer and the provision of sustainable individ-\\nual mobility in the premium segment, taking into account high \\nprofitability, in order to secure the Company’s independence in \\nthe future. The remuneration system contributes to the imple-\\nmentation of the business strategy and the sustainable and long-\\nterm development of the Company. It also takes into account the \\nconcerns of the Company’s important stakeholders (in particular, \\nshareholders, customers and employees). The incentive effects \\nof the various remuneration components have a complementary \\neffect. \\n— The fixed basic remuneration counteracts the temptation to \\ntake disproportionately high risks in order to achieve short -\\nterm goals, and thus contributes to the long -term \\ndevelopment of the Company. It ensures a minimum income \\nappropriate to the tasks and responsibilities of a member of \\nthe Board of Management.  \\n— The variable bonus is divided into two parts, which influence \\nbehaviour in different ways. The earnings-related \\ncomponent of the bonus rewards recipients for achieving \\nthe Company’s financial targets in the vesting year, and \\npromotes the earnings-related parts of the business \\nstrategy. In contrast, the performance component of the \\nbonus is based on non-financial performance criteria, which \\nare also derived from the business strategy. In this respect, \\nthe performance component of the bonus also offers \\nparticular incentives to encourage individuals to pursue the \\ngoals of the business strategy consistently for the long-term \\ndevelopment of the Company. These goals do not have to \\nbe directly reflected in the key financial indicators for a given \\nvesting year. \\n— The amount of the variable share-based remuneration also \\ndepends on the fulfilment of financial and non -financial \\nobjectives derived from the business strategy, since 50% of \\nthe target personal cash investment amount earmarked for \\nshare purchases is linked to a financial key indicator (RoCE \\nin the Automotive segment), and 50% is linked to strategic \\nfocus targets. The obligation to use the total net amount to \\npurchase shares of common stock in the Company and to \\nhold these shares for at least four years is a share ownership \\nguideline that strengthens the entrepreneurial long -term \\norientation of the Board of Management. Implementing the \\ncorporate strategy sustainably by taking appropriate \\ndecisions also creates lasting value for the shareholders, \\nand thus regularly provides the basis for positive long -term \\ncapital market performance. Due to the substantial \\ninvestment and the fixed holding period associated with \\nthese shares, members of the Board of Management \\nparticipate in the long- term positive (and negative)  \\ndevelopment of the Company, as reflected in the share price \\nand dividend trends.

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management  \\n \\n \\n3. Determination and review of the remuneration system and  \\nindividual remuneration \\nDetermining the system and structure of Board of Management \\nremuneration, and reviewing it regularly, is a task of the full Su-\\npervisory Board, as is determining the individual level of remu-\\nneration of members of the Board of Management. The Person-\\nnel Committee of the Supervisory Board assumes a preparatory \\nfunction. \\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration system annu-\\nally to ensure it is appropriate in terms of structure, target and \\nmaximum remuneration, as well as actual remuneration. The Su-\\npervisory Board also takes remuneration studies into account \\nwhen assessing the market conformity of the target and maxi-\\nmum remuneration, as well as when assessing actual remuner-\\nation in horizontal terms. Due to the size and structure of the \\nBMW Group, DAX companies are used as a comparison group \\nwhile taking revenues, employee headcounts and market capi-\\ntalisation into consideration. This ensures that the main compet-\\nitors of BMW AG and other global companies are factored in. Ver-\\ntically, the Supervisory Board compares the remuneration of \\nmembers of the Board of Management with the remuneration of \\nsenior executives and with the average remuneration of employ-\\nees employed by BMW\\u2006AG in Germany in areas inside and out-\\nside the scope of collective bargaining agreements, including in \\nterms of how they have changed over a period of several years. \\nRecommendations from independent external remuneration ex-\\nperts, as well as suggestions from investor and analyst circles, \\nmay also be included in the deliberations. For the 2023 financial \\nyear, the review has shown that the target, maximum and actual \\nremuneration are appropriate. \\nIn accordance with the remuneration system, the Supervisory \\nBoard – acting on the proposal of the Personnel Committee – \\nsets specific target remuneration for each individual member of \\nthe Board of Management for the upcoming financial year, as \\nwell as the performance criteria associated with the variable re-\\nmuneration components provided for in the remuneration  \\nsystem. \\nThe total target remuneration is composed of the fixed remuner-\\nation and the variable remuneration.

For this pur-\\npose, the Supervisory Board adopted an allocation matrix, from \\nwhich an earnings factor is derived based on the values \\nachieved. \\nA minimum value, a target value and a maximum value were de-\\nfined for both key figures before the start of the 2023 vesting \\nyear. If one of the minimum values is not reached, the earnings \\nfactor is zero (corresponding to a target achievement of 0%). If \\nboth target values are reached, the earnings factor is 1.000 (cor-\\nresponding to a target achievement of 100%). If both maximum \\nvalues are exceeded, the earnings factor is 1.800 (correspond-\\ning to a target achievement of 180%, the highest possible per-\\ncentage).

In the 2023 financial year, BMW  AG’s \\nshare of profit attributable to shareholders was €  11.3 billion, \\nand the Group post-tax return on sales was 7.8%. Based on the \\nallocation matrix approved by the Supervisory Board, t his pro-\\nvides an earnings factor of 1.680, which corresponds to a target \\nachievement level of 168%. \\nPerformance component of the bonus \\nThe performance component of the bonus rewards the achieve-\\nment of certain non-financial targets. Before the beginning of the \\nfinancial year, the Supervisory Board sets these targets in the \\nform of various non-financial performance criteria and associ-\\nated metrics. The performance criteria are derived primarily from \\nthe corporate strategy, long-term corporate planning and the \\nbusiness development planning done for the following year. The \\ntargets are divided into individual targets for the individual mem-\\nbers of the Board of Management (departmental targets) and \\ncollective targets for the entire Board of Management (interde-\\npartmental targets). The Supervisory Board has discretion in \\nweighting the performance criteria. Approximately 10% of the \\ntarget amount for the performance bonus is intended to be allo-\\ncated to the departmental targets.

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management  \\n \\n \\nTargets set and extent of achievement – performance component of \\nthe bonus for the 2023 financial year \\nThe targets set by the Supervisory Board for the 2023 vesting \\nyear as part of the performance component of the bonus, the \\nweighting of the relevant criteria and the individual target \\nachievement are summarised in the tables below. \\nThe Supervisory Board assessed the performance of the mem-\\nbers of the Board of Management in terms of the departmental \\ntargets, on the one hand, and the interdepartmental targets, on \\nthe other hand, within a target achievement corridor with a partial \\nperformance factor between 0 (corresponding to a target being \\n0% achieved) and 1.80 (corresponding to a target being 180% \\nachieved, the highest possible percentage). The performance \\nfactor for the bonus was determined from the partial perfor-\\nmance factors, with a weighting of 10% for the departmental tar-\\ngets and 90% for the interdepartmental targets, in each case in \\nrelation to the target amount of the performance component of \\nthe bonus. With regard to the interdepartmental targets, 50% of \\nthe weighting is for non-financial environmental, social and gov-\\nernance (ESG) targets, and 40% is for other non -financial tar-\\ngets, in each case in relation to the target amount of the perfor-\\nmance component of the bonus. \\nThe leadership performance of the individual members of the \\nBoard of Management was assessed along with the overall per-\\nformance of the Board of Management as a whole. With regard \\nto the departmental targets, the Supervisory Board assessed the \\nindividual performance of each member of the Board of Manage-\\nment. With regard to the interdepartmental targets, the Supervi-\\nsory Board considered the Board of Management as a team and \\nassessed the performance of all the members of the Board of \\nManagement as a whole. The Supervisory Board’s decision -\\nmaking process is based on a detailed, documented analysis of \\nperformance as measured against all the agreed criteria, as well \\nas in-depth discussions at Personnel Committee and full Super-\\nvisory Board level. As a basis for the targets set in the previous \\nyear and the assessment process following the financial year, the \\nSupervisory Board was guided, in particular, by the quantitative \\nand qualitative metrics that were defined in the corporate plan-\\nning before the beginning of the financial year. \\nThe results of comparative studies and calculations vis -à-vis \\ncompetitors were also used to assess individual metrics. In addi-\\ntion to a review of performan ce in 2023, the Supervisory Board \\ncarried out a trend review covering several financial years. In do-\\ning so, it assessed the effects of decisions, measures and the \\noverall course set in previous financial years on the 2023 finan-\\ncial year and also estimated the significance of the performance \\nin 2023 for the future development of the Company. \\nThe defined quantitative and qualitative metrics include indica-\\ntors such as vehicle sales, segment shares, the share of sales for \\nelectrified and all-electric vehicles and the share of BMW brand \\nvehicles with remote software upgrade capability. Other metrics \\nincluded assessments of the quality of the customer experience \\ncompared to the competition, the R&D ratio, spending on em-\\nployee training and development and diversity targets.  \\nOverview of targets of the performance component of the \\nbonus for the financial year 20231 \\n \\n1 Based on the target amount of the performance component of the bonus. \\n2 Individual assessment for each member of the Board of Management. \\n3 Collective assessment of the Board of Management as a team.\\n10%\\nDepartmental \\ntargets²\\n50%\\nInterdepartmental \\nESG targets³\\n40%\\nOther \\ninterdepartmental \\nnon-financial targets³'),\n",

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management  \\n \\n \\n(2) Share-based remuneration for the 2023 financial year \\nAs part of the share-based remuneration as a variable long-term \\ncomponent of remuneration, the members of the Board of Man-\\nagement receive a cash payment earmarked for investment in \\nBMW shares of common stock (the “personal cash investment \\namount”). This amount depends on the achievement of certain \\nfinancial and non-financial targets in the past financial year (vest-\\ning year). The members of the Board of Management are obliged \\nto invest their personal cash investment amounts (less taxes and \\nduties) in BMW shares of common stock immediately after dis-\\nbursement, and to hold these shares for a period of at least four \\nyears (share ownership guideline). The holding period remains in \\neffect even if the member leaves the Board of Management. \\nPersonal cash investment amount \\nThe personal cash investment amount for the 2023 financial \\nyear will be paid as part of the next payroll run after the Annual \\nGeneral Meeting in 2024. The size of this amount depends on \\nthe target amount, the RoCE achieved in the Automotive seg-\\nment and the degree to which certain strategic focus targets \\nwere achieved in the vesting year. The personal cash investment \\namount is limited to a maximum of 180% of the target amount \\nand is calculated as follows: \\nPersonal cash investment amount = \\nRoCE component + strategic focus target component \\nOverview of share-based remuneration1 \\n \\n1 Simplified depiction. \\n2 At least two strategic focus targets and their proportion of the target amount are determined by the Supervisory Board. \\n3 Exemplary illustration of price development. \\n4 Payment of the personal cash investment amount, acquisition of shares and the start of the four-year holding period occur as part of the next payroll run after the Annual General Meeting at which the \\nannual financial statements for the vesting year are presented. \\n \\nTarget amount for the personal cash investment amount \\nThe target amounts for the individual members of the Board of \\nManagement for the 2023 financial year are presented in the  \\ntable ↗ Overview of share-based remuneration for financial year 2023. \\nRoCE component of the personal cash investment amount \\nBefore the beginning of the relevant vesting year, the Supervi-\\nsory Board sets minimum, target and maximum values for the \\nRoCE in the Automotive segment in the vesting year on the basis \\nof corporate planning, and assigns a RoCE factor to each of these \\nvalues. If the minimum value is not reached, the RoCE factor is 0. \\nIf the target value is reached, the RoCE factor is 1.00. If the max-\\nimum value is reached or exceeded, the RoCE factor is 1.80. The \\nRoCE component of the personal investment cash amount is \\ndetermined by multiplying the RoCE factor for the vesting year by \\n50% of the individual target amount. \\nStrategic focus targets component of the personal cash investment \\namount \\nThe Supervisory Board sets at least two strategic focus targets \\nbefore the start of the vesting year. It derives these targets from \\nthe corporate strategy and corporate planning. It then sets a min-\\nimum, target and maximum value for each strategic focus target, \\nand assigns a factor to each of these values. If the minimum \\nvalue is not reached, the factor for that target is 0. If the target \\nvalue is reached, the factor for that target is 1.00. If the maximum \\nvalue is reached or exceeded, the factor for that target is 1.80. \\nThe strategic focus targets component of the personal cash \\ninvestment amount is determined in a two -step process. In the \\nfirst step, the factor for the vesting year achieved for the relevant \\nstrategic focus target is multiplied by the share of the individual \\ntarget amount attributable to this target. In the second step, the \\nvalues determined for the individual strategic focus targets using \\nthis calculation are added together. If two strategic focus targets \\nare set, each strategic focus target accounts for 25% of the indi-\\nvidual target amount, unless the Supervisory Board decides on a \\ndifferent weighting. If more than two strategic focus targets are \\nset, the Supervisory Board determines the weighting of each  \\ntarget. \\n50% \\nRoCE factor \\nExtent of target achievement for \\nRoCE in the Automotive segment \\n(value between 0 and 1.80) \\nTarget amount \\n50% \\nStrategic focus target factor \\nExtent of target achievement \\nfor strategic focus targets2 \\n(value between 0 and 1.80) \\nTarget amount \\nTaxes and deductions \\nPersonal cash \\ninvestment amount \\n(capped at 180% \\nof the target amount) \\nAmount paid out \\n= \\n= \\nTotal performance period: 5 years \\nFreely  \\navailable \\nshares \\nPerformance period: 4 years \\nPerformance period: 1 year \\nFY n \\n FY n+1 \\n FY n+2 \\n FY n+3 \\n FY n+4 \\n FY n+5 \\nAcquisition of shares4 \\n(amounting to 100% \\nof the payment amount) \\nShare performance over 4 years3 '),\n",

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management \\n6. Retirement benefits \\nThe retirement benefits system provides for the Company to\\nmake annual contributions to a savings account for every year\\nthat members of the Board of Management are appointed. After \\nthey are confirmed, pension entitlements become vested when\\nthe employment relationship has existed for one year. Members\\nof the Board of Management receive a disability pension in the\\nevent of invalidity. Retired members of the Board of Manage-\\nment are entitled to retirement benefits after the age of 62 at the \\nearliest and after leaving the Board. If a member of the Board of\\nManagement dies before becoming entitled to a retirement or in-\\nvalidity benefit, a surviving spouse or registered partner is enti-\\ntled to a survivor’s benefit; otherwise, surviving children are enti-\\ntled to a survivor’s benefit depending on their age and level of\\neducation. The amount of the benefits to be paid is determined\\non the basis of the amount accrued in each Board member’s in-\\ndividual pension savings account. This figure is in turn based on\\nthe annual contributions and annual profit participation depend-\\ning on the form of investment. For the contributions made, there\\nis a guaranteed minimum interest rate equal to the maximum in-\\nterest rates specified in the German actuarial reserve regulation\\n(Deckungsrückstellungsverordnung). The payment is made as a\\nlump sum or in annual instalments at the discretion of the mem-\\nber of the Board of Management. For entitlements arising before \\n2016, there is an option to receive payment as a lifelong monthly \\npension or in a combined form. In the event of death or invalidity, \\na minimum benefit in the amount of the potential annual pension \\ncontributions that could have been made up to the age of 60 is\\napproved. This benefit cannot exceed ten years of contributions.\\nMembers of the Board of Management who retire immediately \\nafter their service on the Board, or who are deemed to be in an \\nequivalent position, are entitled to acquire vehicles and other \\nBMW\\u202fGroup products and services at conditions that also apply \\nto BMW pensioners and to lease BMW\\u202fGroup vehicles in accord-\\nance with the guidelines applicable to senior heads of depart-\\nments. Retired Chairmen of the Board of Management also have \\nthe option of using the BMW car service, subject to availability \\nand at a charge. \\nFor members of the Board of Management in office in the 2023 \\nfinancial year, expenses for post -employment benefits of € 3.2 \\nmillion were incurred. These benefits correspond in their entirety \\nto allocations to pension provisions in accordance with IAS 19. \\nPension entitlements 2023 \\nin € \\nService cost in accordance \\nwith IFRS for the \\nfinancial year 2023 \\nCash value of entitlements \\nto pension benefits \\nin accordance with IFRS \\nas at 31 December 2023 \\nOliver Zipse 712,729 5,749,540 \\nJochen Goller1 66,667 1,039,801 \\nIlka Horstmeier 407,533 2,704,634 \\nWalter Mertl2 254,444 807,853 \\nMilan Nedeljković 407,391 3,174,055 \\nPieter Nota3 407,516 2,336,557 \\nNicolas Peter4 166,667 4,038,570 \\nJoachim Post 408,504 1,174,735 \\nFrank Weber 407,525 1,845,023 \\nTotal 3,238,976 22,870,768 \\n1 Member of the Board of Management since 1 November 2023. \\n2 Member of the Board of Management since 12 May 2023. \\n3 Member of the Board of Management until 31 October 2023, service contract until 31 July 2024, \\nsee ↗ Premature termination of activities and post-contractual non-competition clause. \\n4 Member of the Board of Management until 11 May 2023, service contract until 31 May 2023, \\nsee ↗ Premature termination of activities and post-contractual non-competition clause. \\n7. Malus and clawback provisions \\nThe current remuneration system provides for the possibility of\\nwithholding variable remuneration (malus) and reclaiming vari -\\nable remuneration already paid out (clawback) under certain\\nconditions. The rules allow the Supervisory Board to withhold or\\nreclaim variable remuneration in the event of certain serious\\ncompliance-related violations (compliance malus and/or compli-\\nance clawback). These provisions can also be applied where var-\\niable remuneration components linked to the achievement of cer-\\ntain targets have been paid out on the basis of incorrect calcula-\\ntion bases or incorrect financial statements. Remuneration can\\nalso be withheld or reclaimed after an individual’s departure from \\nthe Board of Management.\\nThe Supervisory Board has not identified any reason to withhold \\nor reclaim variable remuneration components in the 2023 finan-\\ncial year. \\n8. Premature termination of activities and \\npost-contractual non-competition clause \\nBoard of Management service contracts provide for severance \\npay to be paid to the Board member in the event of premature \\ntermination by the Company without due cause, the amount of \\nwhich is limited to a maximum of two years’ remuneration (sev-\\nerance payment cap). The member will not be compensated for \\nmore than the remaining term of the service contract. If the re-\\nmaining term of the contract is less than two years, the sever-\\nance payment is reduced proportionately. The annual remuner-\\nation paid generally includes the base salary, the target amount \\nof the bonus and target amount of the personal cash investment \\namount, unless the relevant target amount was not achieved in \\nthe previous year. In this case, the bonus that was actually \\ngranted or the personal cash investment amount that was actu-\\nally disbursed will apply.  \\nThere are no specific severance arrangements covering early \\ntermination of a Board member’s mandate due to a change of \\ncontrol or in connection with a takeover offer. \\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for waiving \\nthe holding period for shares of common stock that were ac-\\nquired with share -based remuneration components.

Entitlements to other \\nvariable remuneration components (bonus, personal cash in-\\nvestment amount) are forfeited as soon as they exceed the target \\namounts.  \\nA one -year post -contractual non-competition clause has been \\nagreed with the Board members under specified circumstances \\nagainst payment of a remuneration amount. Service contracts \\nprovide for the payment of a monthly waiting allowance in the \\namount of the applicable monthly base salary for the duration of \\nthe post-contractual non-competition clause. In accordance with \\nRecommendation G.13 of the GCGC, any severance payment is \\noffset against the waiting allowance. The same applies to other \\nincome from third parties, except remuneration for Supervisory \\nBoard appointments approved during the term of office. The \\nCompany may unilaterally waive the requirement to comply with \\nthe post-contractual non-competition clause.  \\nDr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Management on 11 May 2023 \\nby mutual agreement as part of a succession arrangement. He \\nreceived fixed remuneration (base salary and other remunera-\\ntion) of € 0.05 million for the remaining term of his service con-\\ntract up to 31 May 2023. The bonus and personal investment \\ncash amount for the period between 12 May and 31 May 2023 \\ncame to € 0.08 million and € 0.09 million respectively. A pro rata \\npension contribution of € 0.02 million was made for the period \\nbetween him leaving the Board of Management and the end of \\nhis service contract. A one -year post-contractual non-competi-\\ntion clause applies. The waiting allowance contractually owed to \\nhim amounts to € 1.1 million for the period from 1 June 2023 to \\n31 May 2024 and € 0.6 million for the period from 1 June to 31 \\nDecember 2023. \\nMr Pieter Nota left the Board of Management on 31  October \\n2023 by mutual agreement as part of a succession arrange-\\nment. His service contract comes to an end on 31 July 2024. His \\nremuneration will continue to be paid to him on the contractually \\nagreed due dates until the end of his employment contract; his \\nremuneration will not be settled or paid early; he will not receive \\na termination payment. For the period from 1 November to 31 \\nDecember 2023, he received fixed remuneration (base salary \\nand other remuneration) of € 0.2 million, a bonus of € 0.3 million \\nand a personal cash investment amount of € 0.3 million (all pro \\nrata). The pension contribution comes to € 0.07 million for the \\nperiod from 1 November to 31 December 2023. For the period \\nfrom 1 January to 31 July 2024, his base salary comes to € 0.6 \\nmillion, with a maximum bonus of € 0.7 million and a maximum \\npersonal cash investment amount of € 0.7 million. The pension \\ncontribution for the relevant portion of the 2024 financial year is \\n€ 0.2 million. A one-year post -contractual non -competition \\nclause applies. For the period from 1  August 2024 to 31 July \\n2025, the waiting allowance contractually owed to him amounts \\nto € 1.1 million. \\n9. Remuneration granted and owed to members of the \\nBoard of Management pursuant to § 162 of the German Stock\\nCorporation Act (AktG) \\nThe following tables ↗ Remuneration granted and owed  show the re-\\nmuneration granted and owed to the members of the Board of \\nManagement in office during the reporting year in accordance \\nwith § 162 AktG. The remuneration shown for the members of \\nthe Board of Management who left during the year also includes \\nthe remuneration granted and owed in the reporting year after \\nthey leave the company. \\nThe tables include all amounts received by the individual mem-\\nbers of the Board of Management in the reporting period (“remu-\\nneration granted”) and all remuneration legally due but not yet \\nreceived (“remuneration owed”). \\nIn addition to actual amounts received, “remuneration granted” \\nin the reporting year is also assumed to exist if the activity on \\nwhich the remuneration component is based has been fully per-\\nformed by the member of the Board of Management as of the \\nbalance sheet date, and if all conditions for entitlement have \\nbeen met. \\nThus, in addition to the fixed remuneration components, the fol-\\nlowing variable remuneration components are reported as remu-\\nneration granted for the 2023 financial year within the meaning \\nof §\\u2009162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG): \\n— Bonus for the 2023 financial year (to be paid out in 2024) \\n— Share-based remuneration (personal cash investment \\namount) for the 2023 financial year (to be paid out in 2024) \\n— Share-based remuneration component (matching \\ncomponent) for vesting year 2018, due to the expiry of the \\nfour-year holding period in the 2023 financial year (paid out \\nin 2023) \\nThus, the remuneration granted and owed includes all remuner-\\nation components earned through the activities of the members \\nof the Board of Management in the 2023 financial year. In addi-\\ntion, it includes remuneration components already earned as a \\nresult of activity in previous financial years, but for which the re-\\nspective member of the Board of Management’s payment enti-\\ntlement only arose due to the occurrence of conditions in the \\n2023 financial year. \\nIn addition to the absolute amount of remuneration, the relative \\nshare of the relevant remuneration component in the total remu-\\nneration granted and owed is also shown. For the sake of com-\\npleteness, the individual service cost in accordance with IAS 19 \\nfor the Company pension scheme is also shown, although this \\nservice cost is not classified as granted or owed remuneration \\nwithin the meaning of § 162 AktG.

Remuneration of the Members of the Supervisory Board\\nIV. REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF\\nTHE SUPERVISORY BOARD\\n1. Articles of incorporation and procedure \\nThe regulation governing remuneration for the Su pervisory\\nBoard is set out in § 16 of the Articles of Incorporation, and spec-\\nifies both the remuneration system to be used and the precise\\nframework for calculating the remuneration due to the members\\nof the Supervisory Board. The regulation was adopted by the An-\\nnual General Meeting on 14 May 2020 and confirmed on\\n12 May 2021 with a majority of 99.40% of the valid votes cast.\\n2. Principles and elements of remuneration \\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration is structured as a purely\\nfixed remuneration in line with suggestion G.18 of the GCGC.\\nFixed remuneration strengthens the independence of the Super-\\nvisory Board in advising and monitoring the Board of Manage-\\nment. The structure and amount of the fixed remuneration\\nshould ensure that highly qualified individuals can be proposed\\nto the Annual General Meeting for membership of the Supervi-\\nsory Board. This promotes the quality of advice and oversight,\\nwhich contributes to the Company’s sustainable and long -term\\ndevelopment.\\nIn accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, each member of \\nthe Supervisory Board of BMW  AG who does not exercise any \\nadditional function relevant to remuneration receives fixed remu-\\nneration of € 200,000 p.a. \\nThe GCGC recommends that exercising the functions of the chair \\nand deputy chair of the Supervisory Board should also be con-\\nsidered when determining the level of remuneration, along with \\nany committees an individual chairs or sits on (Suggestion G.17). \\nThis is to take account of the extra time commitment associated \\nwith these positions. The Articles of Incorporation of BMW AG \\nalso take account of the requirements for the Audit Committee \\nand its Chairman. They stipulate that the Chairman of the Super-\\nvisory Board shall receive three times the amount, and each \\nDeputy Chairman twice the amount, of remuneration paid to a \\nSupervisory Board member who has no additional remunera-\\ntion-relevant functions. The Chair of the Audit Committee re-\\nceives two-and-a-quarter times the amount, the Chairs of other \\nSupervisory Board committees twice the amount, each member \\nof the Audit Committee twice the amount, and each member of \\nanother committee one-and-a-half times the amount of the re-\\nmuneration paid to a Supervisory Board member, provided the \\nrelevant committee convened on at least three days during the \\nfinancial year. If a member of the Supervisory Board exercises \\nmore than one of the functions referred to above, their remuner-\\nation is measured only on the basis of the function receiving the \\nhighest amount. \\nIn the event of changes in the composition of the Supervisor y \\nBoard during the year, or if additional remuneration -relevant \\nfunctions are performed, remuneration is calculated on a propor-\\ntionate basis. \\nIn addition, each member of the Supervisory Board receives an \\nattendance fee of € 2,000 per meeting for each meeting of the \\nSupervisory Board (plenary) in which he or she participates. This \\nalso applies to participation by telephone or video link. If they at-\\ntend more than one meeting on the same day, the meetings are \\nnot remunerated separately. A continuous session on two con-\\nsecutive days is treated as one session. \\nThe remuneration and the attendance fee are only paid after the \\nend of the respective financial year. Furthermore, the company \\nreimburses each member of the Supervisory Board for their rea-\\nsonable expenses. In order to be able to perform his duties, the \\nChairman of the Supervisory Board is provided with secretariat \\nand chauffeur services. \\n3. Remuneration granted and owed to members of the \\nSupervisory Board pursuant to § 162 of the German Stock Cor-\\nporation Act (AktG) \\nThe following table shows the remuneration granted and owed \\nto the members of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial \\nyear in accordance with § 162 (1) Sentence 1 German Stock \\nCorporation Act (AktG). The activity on which the remuneration \\nfor the 2023 financial year is based was fully performed by the \\nbalance sheet date. Therefore, the remuneration for the Super-\\nvisory Board activities is classified as granted for the 2023 finan-\\ncial year, even if the payment of the Supervisory Board remuner-\\nation (including the attendance fee) was made after the end of \\nthe 2023 financial year.  \\nOverview of remuneration of the members of the \\nSupervisory Board¹ \\nFactor Amount in € p. a.3 \\nMember of Supervisory Board 1.00 200,000 \\nChairman Supervisory Board 3.00 600,000 \\nDeputy Chairman Supervisory Board  2.00 400,000 \\nChairman of the Audit Committee2 2.25 450,000 \\nChairman of other committee2 2.00 400,000 \\nMember of the Audit Committee2 2.00 400,000 \\nMember of other committee2 1.50 300,000 \\n1 If a Supervisory Board member performs more than one of the functions referred to above, their \\nremuneration is measured only on the basis of the function that is remunerated with the highest \\namount. \\n2 Provided that the Committee has met on at least three days during the financial year. \\n3 Plus attendance fee of € 2,000 per plenary session.

AUDITOR’S REPORT  \\nTo Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, München \\nWe have audited the remuneration report of Bayerische Motoren \\nWerke Aktiengesellschaft, München, for the financial year from \\nJanuary 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 including the related \\ndisclosures, which was prepared to comply with § [Article] 162 \\nAktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act]. \\nResponsibilities of the Executive Directors and the \\nSupervisory Board \\nThe executive directors and the supervisory board of Bayerische \\nMotoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the prep-\\naration of the remuneration report, including the related disclo -\\nsures, that complies with the requirements of § 162 AktG. The \\nexecutive directors and the supervisory board are also responsi-\\nble for such internal control as they determine is necessary to \\nenable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the re-\\nlated disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud or error. \\nAuditor’s Responsibilities  \\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration \\nreport, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We \\nconducted our audit in accordance with German generally ac-\\ncepted standards for the audit of financial statements promul-\\ngated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Au-\\nditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we com-\\nply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration \\nreport, including the related disclosures, is free from material \\nmisstatement.  \\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence \\nabout the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the \\nremuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the au-\\nditor's judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of \\nmaterial misstatement of the remuneration report including the \\nrelated disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. \\nIn making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal \\ncontrol relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report in-\\ncluding the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan \\nand perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-\\nstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \\neffectiveness of the company's internal control.

The methodology used to calculate CO2 emissions changed in the reporting year 2023 for the items “Purchased Goods and services” and “Logistics – material supply of the plants and \\ndistribution of vehicles”. The prior-year figures have been adjusted retrospectively. \\n2 Carbon emissions (excluding climate-impacting gases other than carbon dioxide) generated by vehicle production (BMW Group plants and BMW Motorcycle, excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) and by other BMW Group locations not directly related to production (e.g. research centres, sales \\ncentres, office buildings). \\n3 This amount includes 15,881 t CO2 from the direct use of biomass. \\n4 Calculation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, using the operational control approach in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Leased space without the direct influence of the BMW Group on energy supply is therefore not included. \\n5 Includes the emissions of company cars and function-related vehicles of the BMW Group plants, as well as the 12 major markets. Emissions are preferably calculated on the basis of tank refills. This is the case for the plants and/or markets in Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy \\n(only Alphabet Italia S.p.A. and BMW Bank GmbH, Milan), Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea (only BMW Financial Services Korea Co., Ltd., Seoul), Thailand and the UK. In the remaining cases, they are determined based on kilometres driven. For the USA, the data are partly extrapolated for 2023 \\nbecause the information was not yet available for the entire period at the time the data was collected. For BMW Italia S.p.A. and BMW Italia Retail S.r.l., values for the reporting period are calculated based on average kilometres per day. For system-related reasons, the refuelling of company vehicles includes \\nboth business and private trips, except refuelling paid for by employees themselves. \\n6 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also included on a pro-rata basis under employee commuting and use phase (both Scope 3). A distinction in the systems is currently not possible. \\n7 The increase in this metric is the result of the scope being increased as compared to the previous year. Reporting was only submitted for Germany and the international test sites up to and including 2022. During the 2023 reporting year, all BMW Group plants and the 12 major markets were integrated into the \\nfigure. A calculation based on the Scope from 2022 results in a comparative value for 2023 of 80,869 t CO2 (+5.7% compared to previous year). No retrospective adjustment was made. As a result, the figures for 2023 are not directly comparable with previous years. \\n8 As a result of the extensive travel restrictions in place during the pandemic, 2019 is used as a base year for more meaningful comparisons in terms of civil aviation. \\n9 Scope 2 emissions calculated using the market-based method in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance; mainly based on the emissions factors for electricity, district heating and fuels reported by the VDA (each in the latest version dated 12/2023) and occasionally using local emissions factors; \\nalternative calculation using the location-based method: 1,195,818 t CO2. \\nFURTHER GRI INFORMATION  \\nin t CO2  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023 \\nTotal emissions1  147,257,699  132,064,779  137,592,164  130,743,357  134,699,641 \\nSCOPE 1: DIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS            \\nTotal emissions  678,403  678,967  699,713  694,057  713,933 \\nBMW Group locations2, 3, 4   586,638  604,620  631,304  614,117  595,257 \\nCompany vehicles5, 6, 7   85,667  72,554  66,442  76,491  113,431 \\nCompany-owned planes8  6,098  1,793  1,967  3,449  5,245 \\nSCOPE 2: INDIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS            \\nTotal emissions  354,095  130,090  134,849  91,300  110,141 \\nElectricity/heat purchased by BMW Group locations 2, 4, 9   354,095  130,090  134,849  91,300  110,141 '),\n",

As a result of the extensive travel restrictions in place during the pandemic, 2019 is used as a base year for more conclusive comparisons in terms of business travel.  \\n4 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also included on a pro-rata basis under employee commuting and use phase (both Scope 3). A distinction in the systems is currently not possible. \\n5 2019 is not directly comparable to the other years because an improved data basis was available from 2020 onwards. In some cases, figures have been extrapolated based on data collected at major national and international BMW Group locations. The sites in Farnborough, UK, and Woodcliff Lake, USA, \\nwere included in the calculation for the first time in the reporting year 2023. \\n6 The methodology used to calculate carbon emissions changed in the 2023 reporting year. Previously, the CO2e values were calculated on the basis of a small set of TÜV-validated life cycle assessments performed for European vehicles. Enhancements to the IT system have made it possible to perform a \\ndifferentiated calculation for all vehicles taking into account different energy mixes and carbon emission factors for different production regions (see ↗ Glossary). The values in the time series were adapted using this new methodology (values based on prior methodology: 2019: 18,505,921 t CO2e, 2020: \\n16,234,959 t CO2e, 2021: 18,534,765 t CO2e, 2022: 19,758,702 t CO2e). The values for 2019 through 2021 as well as 2023 shown in the table according to the new methodology were subjected to a reasonable assurance audit. The carbon-reducing measures are taken into account from 2022 onwards.  \\nThe implementation of measures for 2022 was subjected to a limited assurance audit. \\n7 Energy consumption values (lower calorific value) in the “Purchased goods and services” category and the “Disposal” category are estimated using the methodology specified in footnote (9): 113,179 GWh in the “Purchased goods and services” category and 908 GWh in the “Disposal” category. \\n8 The absolute emissions in the use phase are based on the ↗ Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet worldwide, including upstream emissions (Scope 3 downstream, well-to-wheel). The total value in t CO2 is the result of multiplying the average value with all BMW Group vehicles sold in the reporting period \\nand an assumed average mileage of 200,000 km (as per VDA 900-100). \\n9 CO2e calculated based on life cycle assessments as per ISO 14040/44 of representative vehicles from the product lines using the “LCA for Experts” tool provided by Sphera (including climate-impacting gases CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, NF3).

This includes activities that avoid or reduce greenhouse \\ngas emissions as well as those that remove greenhouse gases \\nfrom the atmosphere and store them. BVCM is strongly recom-\\nmended by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to vali-\\ndated companies in addition to CO2 reduction in their own value \\nchain. The BMW Group is committed to this reduction hierarchy \\nand already actively manages both direct and indirect carbon \\nemissions from its plants in line with the 1.5°C pathway set by \\nthe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which involves im-\\nplementing significant measures in our value chain, plus addi-\\ntionally engaging in BVCM to address emissions outside our own \\nvalue chain. We voluntarily back these initiatives without them \\ncounting towards the BMW Group’s CO2 reduction targets. \\nBVCM involves, for example, purchasing certificates on the vol-\\nuntary carbon market. Criteria such as additionality, perma-\\nnence, and certification by independent institutions following in-\\nternational standards (Gold Standard) contribute to the quality of \\nthe certificates employed, thereby bolstering the efficacy of our \\ncommitment beyond our internal value chain. \\nIt is also important to us that projects in the Global South create \\na social benefit in line with the Sustainable Development Goals \\n(SDGs). These include, for example, initiatives that create health \\nbenefits such as avoiding open fires in enclosed spaces. \\nBond \\nA securitised debt instrument in which the issuer certifies its ob-\\nligation to repay the nominal amount at the end of a fixed term \\nand to pay a fixed or variable rate of interest. \\nBusiness volume in balance sheet terms \\nThe sum of the balance sheet line items “Leased products” and \\n“Receivables from sales financing” (current and non-current), as \\nreported in the balance sheet for the Financial Services segment. \\nC \\nCapitalisation rate \\nCapitalised development costs as a percentage of research and \\ndevelopment expenditure. \\nCapital expenditure ratio (excluding capitalised \\ndevelopment costs) \\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment and other intangi-\\nble assets (excluding capitalised development costs) as a per-\\ncentage of Group turnover. \\nCapital expenditure ratio (excluding right-of-use assets and \\ncapitalised development costs) \\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment (excluding right-\\nof-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16) and other intangible \\nassets (excluding capitalised development costs ) as a percent-\\nage of Group turnover. \\nCarbon dioxide equivalents/CO2e \\nCO2e is a unit of measurement used to standardise the climate \\nimpact of various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as me-\\nthane or nitrous oxide. This is necessary because the individual \\ngases do not all contribute equally to the greenhouse effect. In \\naddition, the expert committee at the United Nations (Intergov-\\nernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) has defined “global \\nwarming potential” (GWP). This is an index used to express \\nwarming impact compared with CO2 so that all GHGs are aggre-\\ngated.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership \\nbetween the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Busi-\\nness Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), distin-\\nguishes between Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, \\nbased on their various sources. Whereas direct emissions (Scope \\n1) are generated within a company through the combustion of \\nfossil fuels, Scope 2 refers to the indirect emissions caused by \\nthe consumption of electricity and heat from externally generated \\nsources of energy. Additional indirect (Scope 3) emissions are \\ngenerated in the upstream and downstream stages of the value \\nchain, for instance in the supply chain (upstream) and in the sub-\\nsequent use of products and services (downstream). \\nCarbon emissions from BMW Group locations per vehicle \\nproduced (Scope 1 and 2) \\nThis key indicator is calculated from the direct and indirect car-\\nbon emissions of BMW Group locations relating to the number of \\nvehicles produced during the year under report. The carbon \\nemissions result from energy consumption in the BMW Group \\nplants as well as non-manufacturing sites. Electricity from on -\\nsite renewable generation, Power Purchase Agreements for \\ngreen electricity and Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g. guaran-\\ntees of origin) are all taken into account. The conversion is based \\non emission factors for electricity, district heating and fuels from \\nthe German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) in the \\nmost current v alid version and occasionally local emission fac-\\ntors. This key indicator is the basis for measuring the strategic \\ntarget by 2030 with regard to Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The re-\\nporting indicator is t CO2 per vehicle produced. \\nCO2e emissions from the supply chain including transport \\nlogistics per vehicle produced (Scope 3 upstream) \\nA methodology tailored specifically for BMW was created to as-\\nsess the supply chain and logistics emissions in terms of their \\nCO2e equivalents. Due to the absence of supplier -specific CO2e \\nvalues throughout the entire supply chain, a model incorporating \\nindustry averages and, when accessible, supplier-specific data is \\nused. This method draws upon components of ISO 14040/44 \\nand follows common practice in preparing life cycle analyses \\n(LCA). However, it should be noted that this approach may not \\nbe directly comparable with methods or values employed by \\nother companies. Due to a lack of data availability, various esti-\\nmates, assumptions and average values are used to determine \\nthe key indicator. The aim is to improve the quality of the model \\nfor calculating key metrics in future years. This will be achieved \\nby boosting transparency in supply chains and expanding the de-\\ntail of the model, all while maintaining consistency in calculations \\nover time. \\nThe indicator quantifies greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2e) pro-\\nduced during production (GHG Protocol Scope 3 upstream cate-\\ngory 1), including the transportation of purchased goods and ser-\\nvices for production (“inbound”), as well as the global vehicle dis-\\ntribution of BMW Group automobiles (“outbound”) (collectively \\nGHG Protocol Scope 3 upstream category 4). Contrary to the def-\\ninition of the scopes of the GHG Protocol, the following are not \\nincluded: motorcycles, racing vehicles and aftersales products, \\nincluding their transport logistics, as well as purchased IT cloud \\nservices and engineering or development services. \\nBaseline calculation of supply chain emissions \\nThe initial calculation of the supply chain CO 2e emissions for a \\nrepresentative selection of vehicles is based on their bill of mate-\\nrials. This selection reflects the range of vehicle classes (from \\npremium compact to luxury) and types of drive (petrol, diesel, \\nPHEV and BEV) produced during the period under review. \\nFor the representati ve vehicles, the CO 2e emissions of all in-\\nstalled components are calculated on the basis of their material \\ncomposition and related processing steps. Up to around 60,000 \\nindividual entries are evaluated in each case. The CO2e value of \\nthe relevant vehicle is  calculated by adding these contributions \\ntogether. \\nFor the vast majority of vehicle models produced that are not in-\\ncluded in the representative vehicles, there is no individual CO2e \\ncalculation available on a bill of materials basis. A modular scal-\\ning calculation method has been developed to include these in \\nthe overall result: \\nThe bill of materials of the representative vehicles is divided into \\nsections (modules) according to functional criteria, and these are \\nassessed in terms of their total CO2e emissions. Previously un-\\nassessed vehicle derivatives can now be custom -built using \\nthese basic components, with different building blocks selected \\nbased on the specific technical features of the target vehicles, in-\\ncluding engine type, all-wheel drive or body style. Components \\nthat do not fit are scaled from existing ones. The scaling tech-\\nniques are based on empirical data derived from similar analyses \\nas well as on expert evaluations. This encompasses the scaling \\nof detailed bodywork calculations ranging from sedans to touring \\nmodels with identical engine specifications. \\nFor example, in the baseline calculation for 2023, there is a 520i \\nlisted as a bill of materials vehicle, but no 520i Touring. To en-\\nsure that the latter is accurately represented, the calculated CO2e \\nemissions for components like the drivetrain, wheels, seats and \\nso on remain unchanged, while the body values are multiplied by \\na scaling factor when calculating the Touring model. \\nThe methodology outlined above depends on the established \\n“LCA for Experts” database (previously known as “GaBi”) from \\nSphera to ascertain CO 2e factors for energy, raw materials and \\nmanufacturing processes. In this process, the current datasets \\nare consistently used, starting with the 2023 reporting year. Ret-\\nrospectively from 2019 until the release of the current datasets \\nat the end of February 2023, data from 2019 are used to calcu-\\nlate CO2e emissions. \\nThe CO2e emissions of supply chains vary across different re-\\ngions of the world. For this reason, we allocate the productio n \\nsites of the vehicles to one of three regions: Europe, Asia or the \\nUSA. We then calculate the emissions for the entire vehicle sup-\\nply chain using the Sphera datasets that are valid for that region. \\nThe particularly emission-intensive components, battery cells \\nand catalytic converter coating are specifically calculated based \\non their actual production region, regardless of the vehicle’s \\nmanufacturing location. \\nGiven the significant impact of battery cell production on the ve-\\nhicles’ total CO2e emissions, a detailed calculation model is used '),\n",

In addition to the actual assembly sites of the \\nbattery cells, the material compositions and related production \\nprocesses, it also accounts for the unique characteristics of the \\ncell chemistry (anode and cathode) as well as the emissions as-\\nsociated with supplier-specific energy consumption. \\nThis approach gives each vehicle built during the period under \\nreview its specific CO2e value for supply chain emissions. The to-\\ntal fleet value of CO 2e supply chain  emissions is calculated by \\nadding up the CO2e contributions of all vehicles produced in the \\nreporting year. \\nShare of the reported value attributable to the supply chain \\nThe reduction in CO2e emissions compared to the BMW Group’s \\nbaseline is the result of emission-reducing measures in the sup-\\nply chain that were contractually agreed with suppliers and veri-\\nfiably implemented during the reporting year (e.g. electricity from \\nrenewable sources, use of recycled materials). Agreements with \\nsuppliers of aluminium and precious metals as well as high-volt-\\nage storage cells resulted in particularly high reduction contribu-\\ntions. \\nThe CO2e value for these components and materials before the \\nimplementation of measures is initially determined using the \\n“LCA for Experts” database on the basis of the type and quantity \\nof material. The emission-reducing measures are then deducted. \\nThe calculation of the effect is also carried out using industry av-\\nerage values from “LCA for Experts” for green electricity and sec-\\nondary raw materials. \\nThe total emission- reducing measures for all components and \\nraw materials in the vehicles produced in the reporting year that \\nare evaluated in this manner is subtracted from the baseline \\nvalue. This results in the share of supply chain CO2e emissions in \\nthe reporting value of the overall indicator. The methodology for \\ncalculating the supply chain CO2e emissions outlined above \\nmarks a key improvement over the previous approach. This im-\\nprovement allows for the inclusion of agreed-upon emission-re-\\nducing measures at the level of individual components and raw \\nmaterials, among other factors. Until 2022, each vehicle in the \\nfleet was allocated the supply chain CO2e value of the most sim-\\nilar vehicle from a small selection of vehicles that already had \\nTÜV-validated life cycle assessments available. The reporting \\nmetric is then obtained by adding the transport logistics CO 2e \\nemissions, the calculation of which is described in the following \\nsection. \\nAn external service provider commissioned by BMW conducts \\nthe verification of measures at affected suppliers and their sub-\\ncontractors at the impacted manufacturing sites. A defined \\nmethod is used to ensure that the contractually agreed emis-\\nsions-reducing measures are implemented clearly and without \\nduplication in the reporting year. There are some limitations re-\\ngarding the clear and non -repetitive allocation of material flows \\nwith secondary raw materials. Due to the lack of regulatory man-\\ndates, there is currently neither a requirement for the recording \\nand documentation of material flows for secondary materials \\nacross the supply chain (for example on delivery notes), nor is \\nthere a government-operated/regulatory registry similar to that \\nof green energy certificates that facilitates the distinct allocation \\nof secondary materials to specific customers without duplication. \\nTherefore, the secondary material quota is confirmed using sys-\\ntem extracts from the relevant suppliers’ Enterprise Resource \\nPlanning (ERP) systems, along with details and evidence of sec-\\nondary material procurement through mass balances. Further-\\nmore, written confirmation is obtained from suppliers and n-tier \\nsuppliers (via declarations of conformity) to clearly attribute sec-\\nondary materials to BMW products, preventing any possibility of \\ndouble-counting with other customers. \\nTransport logistics’ share of the reporting value \\nThis indicator takes into account transport logistics emissions in \\nthe reporting year. Firstly, inbound and outbound transport flows \\nare documented using IT-enabled billing and movement data to \\ncalculate the CO2e emissions in tonnes and the transport volume \\nin tonne-kilometres. \\nIn inbound logistics (production supply), all transport flows of in-\\ndividual component parts for automobile manufacturing (BMW, \\nMINI and Rolls Royce) are considered. This includes \\ntransportation from the Tier 1 supplier’s shipping location to the \\nreceipt of goods at individual production plants worldwide, in-\\ncluding partner plants and excluding contract manufacturing \\nsites. In outbound logistics (vehicle distribution), all transport \\nflows of new vehicles transported from the production sites \\nthrough compounds and national distributors to individual deal-\\nerships worldwide are considered. Exceptions include partial vol-\\numes from partner plants. \\nCO2e emissions are calculated for the gross weight (component \\nweight including packaging and shipping material) as well as the \\nspecific vehicle weight and the distance travelled in kilometres. \\nThis calculation is based on the respective CO2e emission factor, \\nwhich varies depending on the technology and mode of transport \\n(road, sea, rail or air). The CO2e emission factors used are de-\\nrived from contemporary standards such as the GLEC Frame-\\nwork V3.0 and ISO 14083, supplemented by supplier-specific \\nvalues whenever possible. \\nIn a second step, an  average, derivative-specific inbound CO 2e \\nvalue is assigned to each vehicle produced from the CO 2e as-\\nsessed transport flows, based on plant location and type of drive, \\nand an outbound CO2e value is assigned based on the factory -\\nmarket relationship. If inbound and/or outbound CO2e values for \\nindividual derivatives are missing in the recorded transport \\nstreams (step 1), these are supplemented on the basis of exist-\\ning derivatives with similar transport routes. Consequently, each \\nmanufactured vehicle is allocated an inbound and outbound \\nCO2e factor based on the production site and intended market. \\nThe share of CO 2e emissions attributed to transport logistics \\nwithin the “supply chain and logistics emissions” metric is deter-\\nmined by aggregating the inbound and outbound CO 2e emis-\\nsions of all vehicles manufactured in the reporting year. This ap-\\nproach applies to the CO2e contributions from transport logistics \\nin the base year and in 2022.  \\nCO2e emissions for the years 2019 to 2021 were calculated in \\nprevious corporate reports using a variety of emissions factors. \\nBetween 2019 and 2022, the recording or assessment of CO2e \\nfrom transport movements was consistently improved. Among \\nother things, a new IT system was introduced in 2022 to expand '),\n",

In \\nline with the range of factors and data sources used for emis-\\nsions from 2022 onward, a retrospective assessment of \\ntransport logistics emissions is carried out for the years 2019 to \\n2021, following the same methodology as from 2022 onward. \\nThis involves using factory- or market-specific inbound and out-\\nbound CO2e emissions data from 2022 for the vehicles produced \\nin each corresponding year. Vehicle variants from 2019 to 2021 \\nthat are no longer produced in 2022 will be supplemented on the \\nbasis of existing derivatives with similar transport routes. \\nCarbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet in the EU (Scope 3 \\ndownstream, tank-to-wheel) \\nThe average carbon emissions of a manufacturer’s fleet (use \\nphase) are calculated on the basis of the weighted average of \\ncarbon emissions across all vehicles newly registered during the \\nreporting period. This is based on the volume of new registra-\\ntions by a manufacturer in the EU, including Norway and Iceland, \\nin the calendar year and the individual vehicle -specific carbon \\nemissions determined in accordance with the WLTP type test \\nprocedure. The BMW Group’s fleet carbon emissions figure, as \\nmeasured internally, includes a legally permitted allowance for \\neco-innovations with mi nor significance. The performance indi-\\ncator for reporting purposes is g CO2 per kilometre driven. \\nCarbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet worldwide \\nincluding upstream emissions (Scope 3 downstream, well-\\nto-wheel) \\nThis indicator documents the progress made by the BMW Group \\nin its strategic objective of reducing carbon emissions during the \\nuse phase including upstream emissions (drivetrain energy sup-\\nply) by an average rate of at least 50% per kilometre driven by \\n2030 (base year 2019). For the purpose of this calculation, vol-\\nume-weighted average fleet carbon emissions are calculated for \\nthe core markets EU (27 EU countries including Norway and Ice-\\nland plus UK) (driving cycle: Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehi-\\ncles Test Procedure; basis: vehicle registrations), USA (driving \\ncycle: United States Combined; basis: production volume) and \\nChina (driving cycle: Worldwide Harmonized Test Cycle, subject \\nto China-specific framework conditions for testing; basis: import \\nor local production volumes) before deduction of legal ly \\npermitted credit factors (e.g. supercredits and eco -innovations) \\nand standardised according to the WLTP (European) driving cy-\\ncle. These core markets account for more than 80% of the BMW \\nGroup’s sales. The calculated figures are increased by 10% to \\naccount for possible discrepancies between cycle values and real \\nemissions, as required by the Science Based Targets initiative. \\nThis indicator also includes the upstream emissions of the en-\\nergy sources (fossil fuels and electricity used for charging), in line \\nwith the well-to-wheel approach. This covers the entire impact \\nchain behind vehicle motion, i.e. from the generation and supply \\nof power to its conversion into drivetrain energy. This approach \\nalso includes the environmental impacts associated with the pro-\\nduction of fuel and electricity. For example, to calculate the vol-\\nume of emissions resulting from upstream electricity (drivetrain \\nenergy supply), the BMW Group uses the energy report pub-\\nlished by the International Energy Agency (IEA; reference basis: \\nprevious year) as a basis in order to assess the emissions asso-\\nciated with the electricity mix in its core markets. The perfor-\\nmance indicator for reporting purposes is g CO2 per kilometre \\ndriven. \\nCash flow at risk \\nSimilar to “value at risk” (see definition below). \\nCash flow hedges \\nHedges against exposures to the variability in forecasted cash \\nflows, particularly in connection with exchange rate fluctuations. \\nCommercial paper \\nDeep-discounted bonds with a term of less than one year. \\nConsolidation \\nThe process of consolidating separate financial statements of \\nGroup entities into Group Financial Statements, depicting the fi-\\nnancial position, net assets and results of operations of the \\nGroup as a single economic entity. \\nCredit default swap (CDS) \\nFinancial swap agreements, under which creditors of securities \\n(usually bonds) pay premiums to the seller of the CDS to hedge \\nagainst the risk that the issuer of the bond will default. As with \\ncredit default insurance agreements, the party receiving the pre-\\nmiums gives a commitment to compensate the bond creditor in \\nthe event of default. \\nD \\nDeliveries \\nA new or used vehicle will be recorded as a delivery once handed \\nover to the end user. End users also include leaseholders under \\nlease contracts with BMW Financial Services and – in the US and \\nCanada – dealerships when they designate a vehicle as a service \\nloaner or demonstrator vehicle. In the case of used vehicles, end \\nusers may include dealerships and other third parties when they \\npurchase a vehicle at auction or directly from the BMW Group. \\nVehicles designated for the end user which suffer a total loss in \\ntransit are also recorded as deliveries. Deliveries may be made \\nby BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group \\nretail outlet, or independent dealerships. The vast majority of de-\\nliveries – and hence the reporting to BMW Group of deliveries – \\nare made by independent dealerships. In the US and Canada, \\nthe period start and end dates for the reporting of deliveries de-\\nviate immaterially from the beginning and, respectively, end of \\ncalendar years or calendar quarters and instead follow industry-\\nstandard reporting calendars. In the German-language version \\nof the BMW Group Report, the terms “Auslieferungen” (deliver-\\nies) and “Absatz” (sales) are used interchangeably. \\nE \\nEarnings per share (EPS) \\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings \\nattributable to the shareholders of BMW AG for ordinary and \\npreference shares by the average number of shares in each cat-\\negory. Earnings per share of preferred stock are computed on the \\nbasis of the number of preferred stock shares entitled to receive \\na dividend in each of the relevant financial years. '),\n",

For example, the BMW Group uses the \\ncurrent energy report from the International Energy Agency (IEA; \\nreference basis: previous year) as the basis for calculating emis-\\nsions from electrified vehicles (provision of electrical energy). As \\na result, this approach can be divided into the following two com-\\nponents: \\nThe well- to-tank method takes into account the carbon emis-\\nsions from the supply chain as well as the upstream fuel supply \\nfrom the oil well or the energy generation source. As such, this \\napproach considers the impact chain that arises until the energy \\nis supplied to the vehicle, but does not include the vehicle itself. \\nBy contrast, the tank-to-wheel method takes into account the im-\\npact chain of energy received (fuel, electricity) until it is converted \\ninto kinetic energy by the vehicle. As such, this approach consid-\\ners the impact chain that arises during the use of the vehicle. \\nWorking hours/working times \\nContractually stipulated weekly hours of work. '),\n",

The ↗ GRI Index is also avail-\\nable on the website as a separate document. The reporting pe-\\nriod covers the financial year from1 January to 31 December \\n2023. The statements made in the report generally relate to the \\nBMW Group reporting entity. Any deviations are marked accord-\\ningly. The BMW Group Report 2024 will be published in March \\n2025. \\n↗ GRI Index: 2-2, 2-3, 2-4 \\nExternal audit \\nThe report, comprising the Combined Management Report, the \\nGroup Financial Statements and the additional GRI information, \\nhas been subject to an annual independent audit by Pricewater-\\nhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC” or \\n“Auditor”). Unaudited sections are marked accordingly. The ex-\\nternal audit serves to underpin the reliability and trustworthiness \\nof the information contained therein for the public. The external \\naudit supports the Supervisory Board of BMW AG in fulfilling its \\nauditing duties. Any links and disclosures that refer to infor-\\nmation outside the BMW\\u202f Group Report and the GRI Index are \\nnot part of the audit. The ↗ Remuneration Report 2023 was prepared \\nin accordance with the requirement s of §  162 of the German \\nStock Corporation Act (AktG) and its content audited by PwC. \\nPwC has audited the Group Financial Statements and the Com-\\nbined Management Report for the 2023 reporting year and is-\\nsued an unqualified audit opinion thereupon. Further information \\nis provided in the ↗ Independent Auditor’s Report and the ↗ Independent \\nPractitioner’s Report on Non-financial Disclosures. \\nThe contents of the NFS, in accordance with §  289 b ff. and \\n§ 315 b ff.

The top-\\nics that were categorised as material remain those where the ac-\\ntions of the BMW Group may have a significant sustainability im-\\npact on the environment and society (inside-out) and which may\\nbe of high business relevance to the BMW Group (outside-in). As\\na result, our focus is on alternative drive systems ↗ Electromobility,\\ndecarbonisation along the value chain ↗ Carbon emissions, respon-\\nsible sourcing ↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network , resource manage-\\nment in line with the principle of the circular economy ↗ Circular \\nEconomy, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy  as well as compli-\\nance ↗ Compliance and Human Rights . Employee diversity and equal\\nopportunity ↗ Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Inclusion as well as an at-\\ntractive workplace ↗ Employer Attractiveness and Employee Development\\nare also given high priority within the BMW Group. Our reporting\\nunder the GRI standards also covers topics which are considered \\nmaterial from a double materiality perspective because they\\nhave a significant environmental impact (inside-out) or are of\\nhigh business relevance to the BMW  Group (outside -in). This\\nconcept must be applied from 2024 onwards in accordance with \\nthe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. The topics cov-\\nered in this context are responsible digitalisation ↗ Innovation, \\nDigitalisation and  Customer Orientation , Product and Road Safety\\n↗ Product Quality and Safety, Occupational Health and Safety ↗ Health \\nand Performance  and Sustainable Governance  ↗ Performance \\nManagement.

Infor-\\nmation about the importance of these goals for the BMW Group \\nis provided on our ↗ website. \\nForward-looking statements \\nThis report contains various forward -looking statements con-\\ncerning future developments that are based on the current status \\nof the BMW Group’s assumptions and forecasts. These state-\\nments are therefore subject to a variety of predictable and unpre-\\ndictable risks, uncertainties and other factors, which means that \\nthe actual outcome, including that of the BMW Group’s net as-\\nsets, financial position and results of operations, its development \\nor performance, could differ considerably from those statements. \\nPreparation of non-financial performance figures \\nCertain non -financial performance figures reported by the \\nBMW Group are based on a significant number of estimates and \\nvaluations. Some are complex and subjective in nature, or s ub-\\nject to uncertainty for other reasons. The BMW Group is also con-\\ntinuously updating the policies and procedures used to calculate \\nits non-financial performance figures. It is not always practical to \\napply new policies and procedures to prior reporting periods. Alt-\\nhough the methodology used to calculate indicators is in line with \\nstandard practice, some indicators are not directly comparable \\nwith the values reported by other companies. \\nThe BMW Group is also required to ensure that third parties re-\\nport relevant data to the BMW  Group correctly. These third par-\\nties include independent dealerships - the overwhelming major-\\nity of which report vehicle delivery figures to the BMW Group - \\nand suppliers, which provide the BMW Group with data on the \\nimplementation of agreed measures designed to reduce carbon \\nemissions. \\nStatement on Corporate Governance \\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of BMW \\nAG prepare a yearly combined Statement on Corporate Govern-\\nance in accordance with § 289 f and § 315 d HGB to report on \\ncorporate governance within the BMW Group. The Statement on \\nCorporate Governance is published on BMW  AG’s website at \\n↗ www.bmwgroup.com/ezu. It also includes the Declaration of Com-\\npliance pursuant to § 161 AktG. \\nEditorial comments \\nKey figures presented in the report have been rounded in accord-\\nance with standard commercial practice. In individual cases, this \\nmay mean that figures do not add up exactly to the stated total \\nand that percentages cannot be derived from the values shown. \\nSummarised disclosures of fuel consumption, carbon emissions \\nand electricity consumption are provided in the section \\n↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures. \\n* See ↗ Glossary fo r a definition of deliveries.'),\n",

We focused in \\nparticular on driving forward the Group’s electrification strategy and expanding it to include \\nall segments and markets, as well as on implementing the corporate strategies adopted in \\nthe fields of digitalisation and sustainability. At each of the five plenary sessions of the Su-\\npervisory Board (including one two-day meeting), we held detailed discussions with the \\nBoard of Management regarding the Group’s position. The Board of Management also kept \\nthe Supervisory Board well informed regarding any matters of significance outside the \\nframework of formal meetings. Furthermore, I discussed matters personally and on a regu-\\nlar basis with the Chairman of the Board of Management. In addition, the Chairman of the \\nAudit Committee maintained a direct line of contact with the Board of Management member \\nresponsible for Finance as well as with the external auditor’s representatives outside of \\nmeetings. We regularly dealt with internal Supervisory Board issues and personnel-related \\nmatters without the presence of the Board of Management. Our cooperation, both within \\nthe Supervisory Board and its committees and with the Board of Management, was con-\\nducted in a spirit of trust, respect and constructiveness. Detailed documents on the main \\ntopics of each meeting were distributed to the members in advance. Moreover, the share-\\nholder and employee representatives regularly prepared for the meetings in separate pre-\\nliminary discussions.  \\nIn its reports on the BMW Group’s position, the Board of Management kept us well in-\\nformed at each meeting regarding current developments and the Group’s overall perfor-\\nmance. A regular topic of discussion at Supervisory Board meetings was the development \\nof current sales trends based on figures analysed by brand, segment and market region, for \\nboth the BMW Group and its competitors. There was also a keen focus on electrified vehi-\\ncles and an overview of the Group’s key financial indicators and liquidity situation. \\nCorporate strategy, including sustainability, remained high on the Supervisory Board’s \\nagenda. Following an analysis of the current situation in the automotive industry and the \\nramifications of geopolitical developments, the Board of Management presented us with a \\ndetailed strategy for implementing the automotive transformation. The strategy covered the \\ntopics of electrification, digitalisation and sustainability, highlighting in particular the circular \\neconomy concept as a key element of the Group’s sustainable corporate approach. The \\nBMW Group’s ambitious decarbonisation targets for2030 were also reaffirmed. With regard \\nto digitalisation, the Board of Management has placed the NEUE KLASSE at the centre of \\nits strategy, making it the benchmark for a holistic customer experience. The Board of Man-\\nagement also described the digitalisation of key business processes to the Supervisory  \\nBoard. Further topics covered by the Board of Management’s extensive report were market \\nstrategies focusing particularly on China and Europe, the resilience of supply chains, and the \\nholistic, Group-wide performance programme. The report was rounded off with an analysis \\nof the competition and the outlook for the BMW Group’s product portfolio. \\nAt each meeting, the Board of Management updated us on current issues and projects re-\\nlated to strategy development work and implementation. The Board of Management also \\nreported on recent events such as the Group’s successful appearance at the IAA Mobility in \\nMunich, the world premiere of the all-electric BMW iX2 and the BMW iX5 Hydrogen at the \\nJapan Mobility Show, and the implementation of the major internal training programme \\n“Digital Boost”. \\nThe Supervisory Board also closely monitored developments relating to major strategic \\ncollaborations. In 2023, the focus was once again on the Chinese market in particular, with \\nrespect to both the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture and the cooperation with Great \\nWall Motors for the local production of an all-electric MINI. We were also informed about the \\nstatus of the investments in YOUR NOW.  \\nAt Supervisory Board meetings we regularly addressed the topics of sustainability and \\nESG. In a report on recent developments within the Group, the Board of Management in-\\nformed us about the cooperation with IONITY on rapid charging networks, the conversion of \\nBMW Group plants in Oxford and Swindon to enable the manufacturing of all-electric MINI \\nvehicles, and the successful outcome of the local referendum held in Irlbach-Straßkirchen on \\nthe proposed construction of a new BMW Group plant to manufacture high-voltage batter-\\nies, among other things. Furthermore, we were very pleased to note that the BMW Group \\nwas presented with awards for activities relating to its sustainability strategy, conferred by a \\nmanagement consultancy and the magazine “Automobilwoche”, which voted the Group \\nnumber one in the automobile manufacturer category. Moreover, the Fair Pay Innovation \\nLab awarded the BMW Group a gold medal in the category “Fair Pay Leader”. \\nWithin the framework of a presentation on the perception of the sustainability of the BMW \\nGroup and its brands, we examined the objectives of the Group’s corporate ESG strategy in \\ngreater detail and looked at corporate communication regarding sustainability issues as well \\nas their media coverage. Regarding the energy transformation within the BMW Group as \\nwell as decarbonisation at Group sites, we were informed in particular about the further im-\\nprovement of energy management and the strategy involving the transition to renewable \\nenergy sources at the BMW Group’s existing production sites by 2030. We were also pro-\\nvided with reports on plans for new structures where no fossil fuels will be used (such as the \\nplant in Debrecen, where production is scheduled to begin in 2025). '),\n",

Based on a \\nself-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board at 31 De-\\ncember 2023 fully meets the targets stipulated in the diversity concept and the competency \\nprofile. \\nIn the Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code issued in \\nDecember 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board confirmed that they \\nhave complied with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 28 April 2022 with-\\nout exception and will continue to fully comply with them in future. \\nWe also dealt with the Group’s compliance management system in great depth. In his an-\\nnual report, the Chief Compliance Officer presented changes to the structure and content of \\nthe BMW Group’s compliance management system and the revision of compliance regula-\\ntions. The report also addressed the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Dili-\\ngence Act and the handling of individual cases. Moreover, at the Compliance Days in Mu-\\nnich, the Chief Compliance Officer relayed a message from the Chairman of the Board of \\nManagement that set the “tone from the top”, and addressed operational prevention \\nmeasures.  \\nAt each meeting, the Board of Management informed us about the current status of important \\nlegal framework conditions and regulatory projects. These included in particular the EU’s reg-\\nulations regarding fleet carbon emissions in conjunction with the EU’s “Fit for 55” package \\nand the Euro 7 emissions standards.  \\nThe Supervisory Board examined the Board of Management’s remuneration in great de-\\ntail. It reviewed the target structure, maximum remuneration and expected remuneration for \\nthe Board of Management for the financial year 2023, considering in particular the Group’s \\nperformance and the development of remuneration for senior executives and employees in \\nGermany over the past few years. Based on a comparative study conducted by an external \\nindependent remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that the \\nremuneration paid to Board of Management members for the financial year 2022 and the \\ntarget remuneration for 2023 were appropriate. Detailed information on the Board of Man-\\nagement’s remuneration for the financial year 2023 is provided in the Remuneration Re-\\nport. In December 2023, following thorough preparation by the Personnel Committee, we \\nadopted the variable remuneration targets applicable to Board of Management members \\nfor the financial year 2024, taking into account the budget for 2024, the long-term business \\nplan and the BMW Group’s corporate strategy, including its ESG goals. \\nThe Board of Management updated the members of the Supervisory Board biannually on \\nthe current status of the level of attainment of defined financial KPIs and the KPIs for our \\nESG targets, such as deliveries of all-electric automobiles, fleet carbon emissions, attrac-\\ntiveness as an employer, and diversity. \\nIn addition, key topics from the Board of Management’s individual areas of \\nresponsibility were on our agenda. Markets in the USA, Canada and Mexico as well as the \\n“fourth pillar” markets, in particular India, South Korea and Japan, were the subject of an in-\\ndepth sales report. We discussed regional resilience and the growth strategy for these mar-\\nkets in great depth.  \\nIn the highly detailed risk report, we were brought up to date with the structure and working \\nmethods of the risk management system. A key focus of the report was on geopolitical risks, \\nespecially in the areas of purchasing/supply chains and sales markets as well as the \\npresentation of measures to mitigate risk. On the subject of information security with a focus \\non IT security, we were informed about the organisation and functioning of the information \\nsecurity management system and the structure of the IT security risk model, as well as the \\nmeasures derived from it and their effectiveness. The Board of Management also reported \\non the business performance, sector-specific risk profile and current projects of the Finan-\\ncial Services segment. In addition, we received a report on key topics relating to the Group’s \\ntreasury system, such as funding, liquidity management, hedging strategies for price and \\ncurrency risks and the current state of share buyback programmes.  \\nIn conjunction with the report on HR-related strategies, we looked at the BMW Group’s at-\\ntractiveness as an employer, employee performance and commitment, and workforce avail-\\nability. The Board of Management also brought us up to date on the status of the Group’s \\ndiversity concepts and the extent to which targets have been achieved regarding the pro-\\nportion of women employed at various levels.  \\nIn December 2022, the Supervisory Board agreed to the plan to hold the Annual General \\nMeeting 2023 on a virtual basis in accordance with the regulations applicable at the time. In \\nMarch 2023, the detailed concept proposed by the Board of Management was approved. \\nWith regard to the Annual General Meeting 2024, the Board of Management explained the \\nreasons for its decision in favour of the virtual format to the Supervisory Board.

In view of the ramp-up of electric mobility in an environment \\nthat remains challenging and volatile, the focus was on safeguarding growth and returns. \\nThe Board of Management informed us about plans for the various vehicle and corporate \\nsegments and ambitious long-term targets, while confirming its key objectives for growth, \\nmarket shares and profitability. We were presented with key financial indicators for each \\nsegment, in addition to opportunities and risks for the planning period. After thorough ex-\\namination, the Supervisory Board approved the long-term business plan drawn up by the \\nBoard of Management.  \\nIn December 2023, the Board of Management presented the budget for the financial year \\n2024. After exhaustive discussion with the Board of Management, we gave the budget our \\napproval. \\nI also met with investor representatives on a regular basis to discuss topics specific to the \\nSupervisory Board during the financial year 2023. We touched on corporate governance \\nissues such as succession planning for the Supervisory Board, the system for the Board of \\nManagement’s remuneration and the future format of the Annual General Meeting as well \\nas committee work and the Supervisory Board’s handling of geopolitical risks.  \\nWith the BMW Group’s support, Supervisory Board members attended advanced training \\ncourses on various topics during 2023. At our July meeting held at the BMW Group’s Leip-\\nzig plant, the subject of which was “BMW Group Production – Electrified. Digital. Sustaina-\\nble”, we discussed the topic of sustainability in production and energy generation at BMW \\nGroup sites. In September, we took a first in-depth look at the Group’s technology, architec-\\nture and product strategy for the period as of 2025, and more closely at the strategic mod-\\nules of the NEUE KLASSE. The members of the Supervisory Board then tested new BMW, \\nMINI and Rolls-Royce models at the BMW M Driving Academy in Maisach. This involved a \\ndrive on the A8 motorway in the new BMW 5 Series sedan, where we tried out the level 2+ \\nHighway Assistant. In addition, we were presented with BMW brand design vehicles, sup-\\nplemented by a preview of the NEUE KLASSE. A talk by a renowned Chinese economics \\nexpert on the state of the Chinese economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and on \\nopportunities for multinational corporations provided some interesting insights into the Chi-\\nnese market. The Supervisory Board held two hybrid meetings in October and November at \\nwhich the heads of the responsible internal departments and an external consultant pro-\\nvided us with a comprehensive update on non-financial reporting and the EU taxonomy, fo-\\ncusing on implementation by the BMW Group. We also delved more deeply into the complex \\nprocesses involved in implementing and reviewing the ambitious decarbonisation targets \\nwithin the supply chain as well as the main levers for decarbonisation in this area. \\nThe onboarding programme for new Supervisory Board members was also continued in \\n2023. As part of the programme, new members are given an insight into the BMW Group’s \\nkey business areas and planning processes by representatives of internal specialist depart-\\nments. The programme also includes an introduction to the ongoing work of the Supervisory \\nBoard.  \\nIn late 2023, we reviewed the effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory Board and its \\ncommittees with the aid of a questionnaire, and discussed the findings in our subsequent \\nmeeting. Cooperation both within the Supervisory Board and with the Board of Manage-\\nment was unanimously perceived as constructive and trustworthy. In the current financial \\nyear, we intend to act on proposals to explore certain topics in greater depth, such as bat-\\ntery technology and the circular economy concept.  \\nThe Supervisory Board is careful to avoid any conflicts of interest in the course of its deliber-\\nations and decision-making processes. No conflicts of interest occurred in the financial year \\n2023.  \\nDescription of Presiding Board activities and committee work  \\nThe Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. At each \\nsubsequent Supervisory Board meeting, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr Bock, \\nand myself reported in detail on the work of the Presiding Committee and the other commit-\\ntees. Further information on the duties, composition and working methods of the Presiding \\nBoard as well as the various other committees is provided in the Statement of Corporate \\nGovernance on the BMW Group website. \\nUnless a particular committee was responsible, the Presiding Board prepared the topics for \\nthe plenary meetings at its four meetings in cooperation with the Board of Management and \\nsenior heads of department. It also put forward proposals for reporting within the Supervi-\\nsory Board. The Presiding Board focused especially on the corporate strategy and its sus-\\ntainability-related aspects, in addition to longer-term corporate planning. The report on the \\nBMW Group’s position was discussed in detail at every meeting of the Presiding Board. \\nThe Audit Committee convened eight times in total. \\nIn March 2023, the focus was on preparing for the Supervisory Board meeting at which the \\nfinancial statements for the financial year 2022 were discussed and examined. After verify-\\ning the matter of independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory \\nBoard that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) be \\nelected auditor at the Annual General Meeting 2023. There were no indications of conflicts \\nof interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor. '),\n",

The Commit-\\ntee therefore issued the corresponding contracts to PwC following its election at the Annual \\nGeneral Meeting in May 2023. \\nThe Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas. Moreover, it approved \\nthe scope of the non-audit services to be performed, and received regular reports from PwC \\nregarding these services. At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed the quality of the \\naudit in depth on several occasions. In particular, it received a report from the relevant de-\\npartment on the Group’s experience with the audit of the financial statements for the finan-\\ncial year 2022 and on the results of the survey conducted within the Group for this purpose. \\nBased on this report, the auditor’s description of the quality assurance measures under-\\ntaken, and the Audit Committee’s own experience with the auditor, the audit was found be \\nof good quality.  \\nThe Audit Committee also examined the combined Non-financial Statement of BMW AG \\nand the BMW Group for the financial year 2022, which was part of the BMW Group Report \\n2022. The Audit Committee had representatives from PwC explain the results of their audit. \\nWe have again engaged PwC to conduct a “limited assurance” audit of the Non-financial \\n(Group) Statement for the financial year 2023, to the extent that it relates to parts of the \\nmanagement report that are not subject to a ”reasonable assurance” audit. Going beyond \\nthe formal review required by law, the Audit Committee also engaged PwC to audit the con-\\ntents of the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023. \\nThe Quarterly Statements were presented to us for discussion by the Audit Committee prior \\nto their publication by the Board of Management. Representatives of the external auditors \\nwere also present when the Half-Year Financial Report was discussed in early August \\n2023. \\nThe Board of Management informed the Audit Committee regarding the implementation of \\nthe first share buyback programme (which the Audit Committee had already approved in \\n2022), the redemption of the shares on 18 July 2023 and related reduction in share capital, \\nas well as the second share buyback programme resolved by the Board of Management in \\nMay 2023. \\nAt its meeting in July 2023, the Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and appropri-\\nateness of the BMW Group’s internal control system (including the Corporate Audit func-\\ntion), the compliance management system and the risk management system. In the half-\\nyearly risk reports, we addressed the principal risks facing the BMW Group and their classifi-\\ncation. We focused particularly on geopolitical risks and the resulting risk scenarios, espe-\\ncially for supply chains and sales markets, as well as measures to mitigate these risks. \\nWe also addressed the topic of climate-related risks. We regularly monitor the further devel-\\nopment of the internal control system for non-financial reporting with regard to the Group’s \\nsustainability-related targets. \\nThe head of Corporate Audit presented us with the key audit findings and plans for further \\ninternal audits. The Chief Compliance Officer of the BMW Group reported on the structural \\ndevelopment of the compliance management system, the implementation of operational \\nmeasures and further planning. The report also addressed the implementation of the Ger-\\nman Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. In addition, we received a report on the BMW Group’s \\ntax and customs control system from the responsible head of department. \\nIn its report on the audit of over -the-counter derivatives entered into by BMW AG during the \\nfinancial year 2022, the external auditor confirmed to the Audit Committee the effectiveness \\nof the system in place at BMW AG in complying with the regulatory requirements of the Eu-\\nropean Market Infrastructure Regulation.  \\nThe Audit Committee received regular reports on the state and development of significant \\nlegal proceedings and internal investigations and, in individual cases, discussed product- \\nand emissions-related proceedings with external legal advisors brought in for that purpose.  \\nIn its role as a preparatory body, in the course of 2023 the Personnel Committee convened \\nfour times to deliberate on the remuneration of, and succession planning for, the Board of \\nManagement. The review of the appropriateness of the Board of Management’s remunera-\\ntion for the financial years 2022 and 2023 and the determination of the factors for the \\nBoard of Management’s variable remuneration for those years were the subjects of thor-\\nough preparation within the Personnel Committee. The determination of financial and ESG \\ntargets for the Board of Management’s remuneration for the financial year 2024 was also \\ndiscussed in great detail. In addition, the Personnel Committee prepared for the change of \\nremuneration consultant in the financial year 2023. The renewal of the anticipatory resolu-\\ntion on the approval of loans and transactions by BMW Bank GmbH was also on the \\nagenda.  \\nThe Nomination Committee held one meeting in the financial year 2023 in which it dis-\\ncussed the composition of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. Taking \\ninto account the composition requirements resolved by the Supervisory Board and the rec-\\nommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Nomination Committee is-\\nsued recommendations for the Supervisory Board’s election proposals to the Annual Gen-\\neral Meeting to be held in 2024. \\nThe Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the \\nfinancial year under report.

As the Board of Management member responsible for Finance, he played a key role \\nin shaping the development of the BMW Group with his profound expertise, entrepreneurial \\nflair and vision. His work served to further cement the Group’s excellent reputation, both on \\nthe capital market and in the public eye. We are greatly indebted to Nicolas Peter for his out-\\nstanding contribution.  \\nOn 12 May 2023, Walter Mertl was appointed as member of the Board of Management re-\\nsponsible for Finance. He joined the BMW Group in 1998 and was most recently responsi-\\nble for corporate controlling. Mr Mertl has embodied the Group’s commitment to sustainable \\nprofitability during the transformation for many years.  \\nOn 31 October 2023, Pieter Nota left the Board of Management by mutual agreement, also \\nin line with the BMW Group’s succession plans. After becoming the member of the Board of \\nManagement responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales in 2018, Mr Nota was a key fig-\\nure in driving forward the sale of all-electric models and the digitalisation of the customer \\ninterface. He was also responsible for introducing a pioneering agency model for direct \\nsales in selected markets. We wish to thank Pieter Nota for his excellent work and valuable \\ninspiration.  \\nOn 1 November 2023, Jochen Goller was appointed as member of the Board of Manage-\\nment responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. Mr Goller has been at the BMW Group \\nsince 1999 and has headed up activities in the China region since 2018. In Jochen Goller, \\nwe have appointed an internationally experienced sales manager with particular expertise in \\nthe Chinese market to the Board of Management. \\nComposition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory \\nBoard’s committees  \\nThere were no changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board during the past year on \\nthe shareholder representative side. The Annual General Meeting elected Dr Kurt Bock to \\nthe Supervisory Board for a further term of office of approximately four years. He was sub-\\nsequently appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, member of the Presid-\\ning Board and of the Personnel Committee as well as member and Chairman of the Audit \\nCommittee. \\nWith regard to the employee representatives, in January 2023 Dr Martin Kimmich was ap-\\npointed to succeed the departing long-serving First Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory \\nBoard, Manfred Schoch, for his remaining term of office. Dr Kimmich has been Chairman of \\nthe Munich Works Council and the BMW AG Works Council since 2022. \\nDisclosure of attendance at meetings by individual members \\nThe attendance rate at Supervisory Board meetings was 99%, and 100% for the meetings \\nheld by the various committees and the Presiding Board. The meetings were held in person, \\nwith individual members participating virtually only in justified exceptional cases. Three meet-\\nings of the Audit Committee that dealt with the quarterly reports were held as hybrid meet-\\nings, with individual members connected by either telephone or video call as planned.

PwC initially conducted a \\nreview of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Man-\\nagement Report for the first half of 2023 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee. \\nNo issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial \\nStatements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance \\nwith the applicable provisions in all material respects. \\nThe Company Financial Statements and the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG for the \\nfinancial year ended 31 December 2023, including the Combined Management Report, on \\nwhich PwC has issued unqualified audit opinions, were authorised by the Board of Manage-\\nment on 12 March 2024. These audit opinions were signed for the fifth consecutive finan-\\ncial year by independent auditor Petra Justenhoven (Wirtschaftsprüferin) and, for the second \\ntime, by Michael Popp (Wirtschaftsprüfer) as the auditor responsible for the performance of \\nthe engagement.  \\nAt its meeting held on 29 February 2024, the Audit Committee initially gave in-depth con-\\nsideration to the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements and \\nthe Combined Management Report (including the combined Non-financial (Group) State-\\nment and the information on the EU taxonomy) as well as the draft version of the auditor’s \\nlong-form reports.  \\nImmediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Com-\\npany and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2023 and the Combined Man-\\nagement Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement) to the Supervi-\\nsory Board. The auditor’s long-form audit reports were also submitted to the Supervisory \\nBoard in a prompt manner. In order to facilitate preparations, drafts of these documents had \\nalready been made available to the Supervisory Board in advance. \\nAt its meeting held on 13 March 2024, the Audit Committee diligently examined and delib-\\nerated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of \\nthe Supervisory Board on 14 March 2024.  \\nAt the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided a detailed explanation \\nof the reporting documents submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. \\nThe representatives of the external auditor reported on the main findings of their audit and \\nanswered questions put to them by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory \\nBoard, partially without the presence of the members of the Board of Management. Both \\nthe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board gave meticulous consideration to the key \\naudit matters and the related audit procedures. \\nThe representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system \\nestablished by the Board of Management is capable of identifying at an early stage any de-\\nvelopments that might threaten the Company’s going-concern status. They also confirmed \\nthat no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system \\nwere identified with regard to the financial reporting process. \\nIn the course of their audit work, they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the con-\\ntents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 of the German Stock Corporation \\nAct (AktG) jointly issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. \\nBased on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory \\nBoard, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the final result \\nof this examination, no objections were raised. At our meeting held on 14 March 2024, we \\naccordingly approved the Group and Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the fi-\\nnancial year 2023. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December \\n2023 have therefore been adopted. \\nFurthermore, in both the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we examined the \\nBoard of Management’s proposal to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of \\n€ 6.00 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend and € 6.02 for each \\nshare of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend and to transfer the remaining amount \\nto other revenue reserves. We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore ap-\\nproved it. \\nBased on the preparatory work of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the \\nBoard of Management jointly prepared the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 \\nin accordance with § 162 AktG. At the request of the Audit Committee, PwC reviewed the \\ncontents of the Remuneration Report, reported to both the Audit Committee and the Super-\\nvisory Board on the results of the review, and confirmed that the Remuneration Report com-\\nplies with the financial reporting provisions contained in § 162 AktG in all material respects.  \\nThe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also carefully examined the combined \\nNon-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2023. Following an in-\\ndepth explanation of the statement by the Board of Management, representatives of PwC \\npresented the key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the \\nmembers of the Supervisory Board. Based on the “limited assurance” audit performed by \\nPwC on those parts of the Management Report and certain sustainability disclosures in the \\nintegrated BMW Group Report 2023 that were not subject to a reasonable assurance en-\\ngagement, PWC issued an unqualified opinion, signed for the second time by Michael Popp \\n(Wirtschaftsprüfer) and for the first time by Annette Fink.

Entrepreneur Herbert Quandt laid the foundation for this many years ago. \\nHis family’s next generation and all of us who work at the Company are following his legacy. \\nIn his spirit, the Company and its employee representatives work together – negotiating \\nfirmly, but always focused on finding solutions for the future. That, too, is our lived BMW cul-\\nture. \\nAll these things make your Company strong and resilient. This is especially true in the cur-\\nrent conditions, where we face a variety of  extremely demanding requirements in individual \\nregions of the world, with geopolitical uncertainty and entirely new challenges constantly \\nemerging. We provide a substantial response to all these things. \\nMore than 150,000 associates worldwide carry your Company forwards through their hard \\nwork and dedication every day. They all value your commitment and your loyalty to the \\nBMW Group as shareholders. \\nYour Company intends to stay on track for success. \\nOur business model – individual premium mobility in its different forms and in line with re-\\ngional requirements – continues to offer substantial potential for achieving profitable growth \\nand gaining market share. \\nWe are taking advantage of these opportunities in our rolling strategic approach and our long-\\nterm corporate planning. What sets us apart is that we make conscious decisions, that are \\nconsistently based on facts, empirical findings and well-founded analysis – not driven by the \\ncurrent “zeitgeist” or short -term hypes. And, of course, it takes experience and sometimes \\nalso common sense. \\nOur BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad brands enjoy an excellent reputation \\nworldwide. Our products don’t just get people from A to B; they touch hearts and spark \\nemotions. Our customers experience their mobility in a very individual way. To achieve this, \\nwe are making mobility more human, more intelligent and more sustainable. \\nA glance in the rear-view mirror shows that we are certainly capable of doing this: BMW has \\novercome difficult situations many times in the past. This certainty has shaped our self-con-\\nfidence for 108 years. Your Company has constantly reinvented itself – taking bold leaps in \\ninnovation at exactly the right time.  \\nTiming is key in whether innovations gain traction and the Company stays relevant, but it is \\nalso clear that: \\nThe future is always ahead of us. And we are prepared! \\nWe know where we are headed at all times and we know what we need. Our consistent be-\\nhaviour shapes the image of your Company in the eyes of the public and among our stake-\\nholders. People expect us to consider things carefully and to come up with practical solu-\\ntions. We “walk the talk” – people know that we take big leaps, but that we also deliver. All-\\nelectric vehicles are projected to account for half of our global deliveries before 2030. We \\nare right on track. \\nYour investment in the BMW Group must be worth it.  \\nYour Company is robust and financially strong. Our Automotive EBIT margin for financial year \\n2023 was within our upwardly adjusted target range of 9.0 to 10.5%.  As you know, we are \\nstill targeting a range of 8 to 10% in the long term. At Group level, our EBT margin for 2023 \\nof 11% exceeded our strategic target of 10%.  \\nOur profitability puts us in a position where we can once again pay you an attractive dividend. \\nWe are making major investments in our future. The same applies to 2023 as well as to the \\ncurrent financial year. Our R&D spending focus on our products, further electrification and \\ndigitalisation of our line-up and automated driving. At the same time, we are investing in the \\nNEUE KLASSE mega-project, our modular kits, construction of high-voltage battery produc-\\ntion facilities in various markets, and the new plant in Debrecen, to name just a few examples. \\nYour Company is going to profit noticeably from all this in the coming years. \\n  \\n‘‘We make conscious decisions, that are  \\nconsistently based on facts.’’ '),\n",

As anticipated, we not \\nonly posted solid year-on-year growth, but also achieved a new all-time high at Group level. \\nOur brands performed very well individually , too, with new all-time highs for BMW, BMW M, \\nRolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad. Despite the model changeover due to the extensive realign-\\nment of the brand, MINI reported higher sales than the previous year. \\nOur core BMW brand maintains its leading position in the global premium segment. In \\nMarch 2024, BMW was ranked number one in the US by the consumer portal “Consumer \\nReports”. This independent platform compared test ratings, reliability, customer satisfaction \\nand safety criteria among 34 automotive manufacturers. Four BMW models even earned \\nthe “Green Choice” environmental seal for being among the vehicles in the United States \\nwith the lowest emissions. \\nDynamic growth for our all-electric models. \\nIn addition to significant growth in the luxury class and upper premium segment, the strongest \\nimpetus for growth last year came from our all-electric vehicles. We sold over 375,000 BEVs \\n– which is about 75% more than the previous year. This means that, by the end of 2023, all-\\nelectric vehicles made up around 15% of our total sales.\\nThis is also reflected in our share of the global BEV market: at 4.1%, it is already significantly \\nhigher than our share of the total global market, which remains stable at 3.3%. \\nBy the end of 2024, we will have more than 15 all- electric models in our line- up across all \\nbrands, from MINI to BMW to Rolls-Royce. All of this speaks for our fresh and highly attractive \\nproduct range – across all brands, all segments and all drive technologies. \\nIn 2023, all our new vehicles went into production or were released onto the market, as \\nplanned, including the new BMW 5 Series and the new BMW X2 with the all-electric variants, \\nthe i5 and iX2. MINI also presented two models from the all -new MINI family at the IAA  \\nMOBILITY: the Cooper 3-door and the Countryman. \\nBMW Motorrad celebrated its centenary in late September of last year, with Federal Chancel-\\nlor Olaf Scholz attending the anniversary celebrations at the Berlin-Spandau plant. There \\nwere two main highlights: the inauguration of the BMW Motorrad Welt – the counterpart to \\nour BMW Welt in Munich, as a delivery and visitor centre – and the premiere of the R 1300 \\nGS. Fans all over the world have been eagerly awaiting this leap in the next GS generation. \\nAll I have to say is: pure high-tech on two wheels – earning extremely positive feedback from \\nthe trade press. \\nOur technological expertise is delivering results.  \\nOur broad, yet centred, approach, with systematic further development of all drive technol-\\nogies, reflects BMW’s typical self-belief, as well as the effectiveness of our strategy. General \\nrecognition of our strategy keeps on growing since we continue to present measurable suc-\\ncesses in decarbonisation. \\nYour Company outperformed the EU CO2 fleet target by 20%. \\nAs in previous years, we not only met the EU CO2 fleet target for the use phase in 2023, but \\nsignificantly overfulfilled it: the BMW Group’s numbers came in at 26.5 grams significantly \\nbelow the applicable limit for the reporting year of 128.6 grams of CO 2 per kilometre. We \\ntherefore ended up below the CO2 limit set for BMW by more than 20%. \\nAs you can see, we are continuing the positive trend of recent years, through further electri-\\nfication of our vehicle portfolio and by using innovative Efficient Dynamics technologies \\nthroughout our entire fleet. \\nTechnology openness in BMW 5 Series and 5 Series Touring. \\nFollowing on from the new BMW 5 Series Sedan, which has been available since late 2023, \\nthe new BMW 5 Series Touring is another perfect example of how our comprehensive tech-\\nnological expertise works in practice.  \\nThe Touring, which will be launched this spring, is especially popular in Europe. Here, also, \\ncustomers will have four drive concepts to choose from: all-electric, plug-in hybrid or highly \\nefficient diesel and petrol engines with 48-volt mild-hybrid technology. BMW is where Touring \\nmeets e-drive. No one else in this segment offers a vehicle like the all-electric BMW i5 Tour-\\ning, with an electric range of over 500 kilometres.  '),\n",

Both M variants come with \\nan impressive partially electrified drivetrain. \\nOur plug-in hybrid models remain an important element of our drivetrain portfolio. Current \\nGen5 battery technology already enables an attractive range. Plug-in hybrids also provide a \\nboost to e-mobility that should not be underestimated. Many customers discover the ad-\\nvantages of electric driving for the first time this way. \\nEarly in 2024, we passed the milestone of two million electrified vehicles sold. This includes \\nboth pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. \\nWe are already testing hydrogen drivetrains in everyday situations. \\nWe have been testing the BMW iX5 Hydrogen on the road in selected countries under every-\\nday conditions since last year. Our pilot fleet’s world tour has raised awareness of the role \\nhydrogen can play in the energy transition – not just for mobility, but ind ustry-wide. We see \\nhydrogen as a possible alternative drive technology in the mid to long term.  \\nOur vehicles performed well under various climate and traffic conditions – and the public re-\\nsponse has been overwhelmingly positive. This is understandable, since hydrogen fuel cell \\ndrivetrains combine the best of both worlds: the advantages of an emissions-free e-drive, \\nwith the fast refuelling people are used to. We also demonstrated this at the COP28 UN Cli-\\nmate Change Conference in Dubai. Your Company is supporting the growth of the hydrogen \\neconomy worldwide, as well as locally, including expansion of infrastructure networks for \\nhydrogen filling stations.\\nWe aim to continue our profitable growth. \\nAll our brands and drivetrain variants help assure the continued profitable growth of your \\nCompany. We expect to see significant double-digit growth in sales of our BEV models again \\nin 2024. We continue to steer the e-mobility ramp-up smartly and precisely in line with differ-\\nentiated demand in all regions of the world. \\nWe presented our latest models to members of the international media in Portugal in Febru-\\nary 2024. Shortly afterwards, we invited 1,500 retailers from 30 European countries to Am-\\nsterdam for a glimpse of the future, including the new BMW 1 Series and the latest edition of \\none of our top-selling individual models, the BMW X3. \\nThe new MINI models for 2024 include the next member of the new MINI family, the Aceman, \\nwhich will celebrate its world premiere in April 2024. This electric -only crossover in the pre-\\nmium compact-car segment will also bring a massive leap in digitalisation. MINI has a de-\\nvoted community and creates a unique sense of life and community spirit.  The new MINI \\nfamily is produced at our Chinese joint venture, Spotlight, in Oxford, UK, and, for the first time, \\nin Germany, at the Leipzig plant. At Rolls-Royce, Spectre is the first battery-electric model to \\nbecome available. Rolls- Royce has long been a standout and unrivalled in the ultra- luxury \\nclass with exclusive models. \\nWith the CE02, BMW Motorrad is already releasing its second all-electric model onto the mar-\\nket, as well as the second M motorcycle model, the M 1000 XR, and the R 1300 GS Adven-\\nture. That means there will be no fewer than three new top models at BMW Motorrad. They \\nall illustrate the breadth of the product line -up. Everyone – and that also applies to me as a \\nmotorcycle rider – can find the right bike for their needs at BMW Motorrad. \\nNEW RETAIL: direct sales as win-win for everyone involved. \\nIn January 2024, we sold and delivered our first vehicle, a MINI, through our new sales sys-\\ntem. We have already switched the MINI brand to a direct sales model in Poland, Italy and \\nSweden, with other European markets to follow. In China, we have been successfully using \\nthis approach for MINI since 2023. \\n‘‘We are steering the e-mobility ramp-up smartly \\nand precisely in line with demand in all regions of the world.’’  \\n \\n '),\n",

Our retail \\npartners and their profitable business model will remain an essential pillar of these new \\narrangements. \\nAutomated driving: the car as digital companion. \\nIt goes without saying that we offer our customers the newest innovations and the latest, \\nstate-of-the-art technology. Over-the-air upgrades ensure that every one of our vehicles is \\nalways digitally up to date. The art lies in mast ering this process: we anticipate far in advance \\nwhat our customers are going to need and want in five to ten years’ time. That is how we \\nensure they get the best overall package from us. This is our aspiration. \\nAnd that is why we keep setting benchmarks: \\nThe BMW 5 Series Sedan is the first car in Germany to be approved for partially automated \\ndriving at speeds up to 130 km/h on motorways. The BMW Highway Assistant allows the \\ndriver to take their hands off the steering wheel while driving longer distances. We also \\nadded a completely new feature: Active Lane Change Assistant with eye confirmation. This \\nallows the vehicle to make an automated lane change without a steering intervention: a \\nglance in the exterior mirror is all that is required. \\nTaking your hands off the steering wheel and even being able to temporarily turn your atten-\\ntion away from the road – that is Level 3 highly automated driving. From March 2024 on-\\nwards, our customers will be able to do precisely this in the models of the new BMW 7 Series. \\nBMW Personal Pilot L3 is the name of this new function, which takes over driving in certain \\nd\\nefined traffic situations and manages speed, distance and lane tracking autonomously.  \\nFor us, the highest le vel of premium functionality g oes hand in hand with maximum safety \\nfor our customers and all road users. We therefore opened the Future Mobility Development \\nCentre in Sokolov in the Czech Republic in summer 2023, where we are testing automated \\ndriving and parking functions, up to and including fully automated driving (Level 4). At this \\nlocation, we are able to simulate virtually all situations that occur in road traffic and thus en-\\nsure the maturity of our technical solutions. \\nNEUE KLASSE – vision becomes reality. \\nWith its spectacular Vision Vehicles, your Company showcases time and again indicates the \\ndirection in which we are taking mobility, in line with the major global topics of the future – \\nthrough bold leaps in innovation and responsible action. This is what our NEUE KLASSE \\nmega-project represents in a unique way.  \\nLast year, there were two major milestones: at the CES in Las Vegas at the start of the year, \\nwe unveiled our BMW i Vision Dee, full of digital innovations. Then, in September, at the IAA \\nMOBILITY, we presented our BMW VISION Neue Klasse. No other car at the IAA MOBILITY \\nreceived as much media coverage and attention as the BMW VISION Neue Klasse. \\nWe also presented this Vision Vehicle to our associates at an exclusive evening event. The \\ninterest was huge. Up to 700 associates from across Germany were selected by lottery to \\nattend the event live with a companion. Another 25,000 watched the live stream or the re-\\ncording of the event. That is a sixth of our global workforce. I see that as genuine interest in \\nour joint future project, the NEUE KLASSE. \\n‘‘We anticipate far in advance what our \\ncustomers want. That is how we ensure \\nthey get the best overall package from us.’’'),\n",

The innovations of the NEUE KLASSE will benefit all future BMW \\nmodels. \\nWe are preparing to launch the NEUE KLASSE onto the market at an unprecedented pace \\nfrom 2025 onwards, with six models within just 24 months of the start of production. We \\nshowed the scope of the NEUE KLASSE in a very concrete way for the first time at the BMW \\nGroup Annual Conference on 21 March 2024. Its offering ranges from sporty sedan to X \\nmodel. The BMW VISION Neue Klasse and our newest Vision Vehicle – the BMW VISION \\nNeue Klasse X – represent these two bookends. \\nI can promise you that both Vision Vehicles will be on the market soon in a very similar form. \\nIn-between these two models, there is plenty of room for everything that will define the BMW \\nbrand in the future. \\nThe Board of Management members already had the chance to drive prototypes of the \\nNEUE KLASSE. What a fantastic driving experience! The first camouflaged prototypes are \\nalready being tested on the roads and we will be building the first pre-production vehicles \\nbefore the end of the year. \\nAfter the official start of production, in 2025, at our newest BMW plant in Debrecen, Hun-\\ngary, the NEUE KLASSE will also come off the production line at our oldest plant in Munich \\nfrom 2026, with other locations worldwide to follow. Incidentally, one out of every two \\nBMWs leaving the Munich production line is already fully electric today. From 2027 on-\\nwards, our more than 100-year-old main plant will build only electric vehicles. \\nMobility is movement – and movement requires energy and functioning supply \\nchains. \\nWe are talking here about powerful, innovative and sustainably produced battery cells – in \\nother words, high-voltage batteries. In the models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will be using our \\nnewly developed round lithium-ion battery cells, which have been optimised for the new ar-\\nchitecture, for the very first time.  \\nOur sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology represents an enormous leap in technology, \\ncompared to the previous generation: we are increasing energy density by more than 20 %, \\nimproving charging speed by up to 30% and boosting range by around 30% – at the same \\ntime as lowering costs. We are also reducing CO 2 emissions from cell production by up to \\n60%. \\nFor both basic research and development of mass-manufacturing processes for high-voltage \\nbatteries, your Company is relying on in -house expertise. We want to understand every as-\\npect of the high-voltage battery. To do so, we have created the necessary conditions for this \\nwith the Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich and the Cell Manufacturing Competence \\nCentre in Parsdorf, Bavaria, enabling us to span all value creation processes involved in cell \\nproduction; this is a crucial step for us. \\nThe Gen6 batteries for our plants in Bavaria will be supplied from our planned new location \\nin Irlbach-Straßkirchen from 2026 onwards. Before embarking on the building project, we \\nsought frank and open dialogue with local residents. We were very pleased that they voted \\nstrongly in favour of our site and see this as confirmation of our efforts. \\nYour Company is building production facilities for BMW high-voltage batteries not just in \\nLower Bavaria, but all over the world – always in close proximity to our vehicle plants in \\nHungary, the US, Mexico, China and Thailand. Our strategic “local for local” approach also \\nguarantees short transport distances for high-voltage batteries and secures our supply \\nagainst unforeseen events in different regions of the world. \\nWith our “i Suppl y Chain” strategy, we are ensuring resilient, excellent and digital supply \\nchains in all areas. Our plants worldwide need supplying with 36 million parts every day – at \\nthe right time, in the best quality and in the right quantity. For the digitalisation of our supply \\nchains, we are relying on Catena-X, a shared data ecosystem for automotive manufacturers, \\nsuppliers and subcontractors, as well as recycling companies in the future. This digital collab-\\noration increases efficiency and transparency – for example, around the carbon footprint and \\noptions for tracing components and raw materials. \\n‘‘The NEUE KLASSE is much more than just a \\nsingle car. It is an entirely new generation of BMW models - -- all of them developed with an \\nall-electric heart, fully digitalised and with a \\nclear focus on sustainability.’’'),\n",

Your Company did exceptionally well to make it into the top 10, \\nand was, in fact, the highest -ranked automotive manufacturer in the global comparison. \\nThree criteria were decisive for this assessment: revenue growth, sustainability and employee \\nsatisfaction. These three are not opposing factors but belong together. \\nWith regard to employees: in autumn 2023, we once again asked our global team to share \\ntheir opinion. For the first time, all 150,000 associates worldwide were able to take part. \\n84% took advantage of this opportunity. \\nThe vote was unequivocal: 85% support our strategy – our BMW way. Another very clear \\nmajority of 88% said they would recommend our Company as an employer. 93% are proud \\nto work for the BMW Group.  \\nIs there any better foundation for continuing on our successful course together? \\n2023 was another strong team effort. \\nPersonally, and on behalf of the entire Board of Management, I would like to thank all our \\nassociates. Everyone made a valuable contribution. I would also like to thank all our custom-\\ners worldwide, our retail organisation and our suppliers.  \\nAll of us at BMW are united by a can-do spirit: think ahead – perform – succeed! \\nDear Shareholders, \\nOur business environment will again be dominated by a great many challenges this financial \\nyear, including weak economic development in several markets, the price development in the \\nautomotive sector, high interest rates and the uncertainty created by geopolitical shifts. \\nThat is why it is so decisive that we recognise and systematically exploit our opportunities. It \\nis important to me that all of us at the BMW Group approach our tasks with self-belief, confi-\\ndence and the necessary grit. I travel the world a lot, visiting our markets and facilities. \\nEverywhere I go, I see how valuable and important individual mobility is in many people’s \\neveryday lives. \\nCourage, pride in performance and resilience. \\nThat is what makes your Company different. We dare to chart our own course, even in turbu-\\nlent times; we are able to withstand the headwinds, as long as we are convinced that we are \\non the right path. \\nYour Company is a high-performance organisation. That is why we once again have ambi-\\ntious plans for 2024: on the automotive side, 14 new models will go into production and \\nBMW Motorrad will release a further 12 new models – not to mention numerous model up-\\ndates and engine variants. We have never postponed a launch and we will not waver from \\nthis. \\nAll of this shows that we are continually laying the foundation for our future success. That is \\ncontinuous progress. In other words: ↗ DRIVING THE NEXT ERA. \\nThat is why the following applies to your Company: \\nStrong today – strong tomorrow. \\nOliver Zipse \\nChairman of the Board of Managemen\\n‘‘Our customers experience their mobility in a \\nvery individual way. We therefore are continually laying the foundation for our future success.  \\nThat is continuous progress. ’’\\n'),\n",

The \\nBMW Group kept investors, analysts and rating agencies up to \\ndate again in 2023 with its regular quarterly and annual report-\\ning. The BMW Group has stepped up its communication with in-\\nvestors who consider sustainability criteria in their investment \\ndecisions in the past few years and now meets this group’s in-\\nformation needs with in-person and virtual ESG conferences, in \\naddition to individual and group meetings. The Group’s commu-\\nnication focused on the further development of the business \\nmodel, digitalisation and other technology trends in the automo-\\ntive industry, sustainability in the supply chain and the ramp-up \\nof electromobility. In 2023, the Group also focused on measuring \\nthe carbon footprint of its pension plan assets in the UK and Ger-\\nmany, and validating the data available for this purpose. The \\n↗ TCFD Report was created for the UK BOPS* Plan, reiterating the \\ntarget to achieve carbon neutrality for the scheme’s asset port-\\nfolio by 2050. \\nThe volume of non-liquid pension plan assets invested in our var-\\nious impact funds continues to grow according to schedule, with \\nseveral new subscriptions exercised in the form of fund-based \\ninvestments.

This area \\nis undergoing constant change, with the market environment \\nevolving dynamically and new collaborative models emerging. \\nNew solutions, particularly in artificial intelligence, are emerging \\nand are finding applications across all aspects of life. Modern ve-\\nhicles are already one of the most complex digital items owned \\nby consumers. Vehicle requirements are also increasingly influ-\\nenced by the digital ecosystems that customers interact with \\nevery day. Automobiles should be a reliable source of support in \\neveryday life, fit seamlessly into a person’s living environment \\nand create a holistic overall experience. Software updates with \\nfurther functional developments are expected and generally be-\\ncoming standard. ↗ Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation \\nAlongside digitalisation, development of automated/autono-\\nmous driving remains a key expectation for the future of mobility. \\nInitial offerings of Level 4* features are expected to launch in the \\nmarket before 2030, although widespread adoption is expected \\nto occur only after 2030. ↗ Products \\nThe acceleration of electromobility worldwide continues to be an \\nimportant prerequisite on the path to climate neutrality, although \\nthe pace of adoption is expected to vary regionally. In the long \\nterm, there will be a parallel range of electric vehicles and com-\\nbustion engine vehicles available worldwide. However, the num-\\nber of all-electric models in the automotive industry as a whole is \\nexpected to continue to increase. Addressing remaining uncer-\\ntainties, including regulations, the swift and widespread develop-\\nment of charging infrastructure and the availability of raw mate-\\nrials will be essential for the future expansion of this sector. It is \\nnecessary to increase the pace at which capacities are expanded \\nin order to meet the ever-increasing demand for climate-neutral \\nand green energy across industries. The share of regenerative \\nenergies in the energy mix is on the rise, increasing the volatility \\nof the entire energy supply and making it increasingly difficult to \\nmaintain the stability of networks. Due to these factors and the \\nlimited capacities of distribution networks, every effort needs to \\nbe continued to ensure that elec tromobility is a long -term suc-\\ncess. ↗ Electromobility  \\nEnvironment \\nAs governments around the world work to transpose the goals of \\nthe Paris Climate Agreement’s carbon reduction targets into na-\\ntional laws, an ambitious orientation towards climate policy will \\nserve as an important basis for successful action for businesses. \\nIt is equally vital to prepare for the consequences of current and \\nanticipated changes brought about by climate change, which \\ncreate a tangible urgency to take action. The role of hydrogen as \\nan energy source is set to undergo a fundamental shift, propelled \\nby the global imperative for decarbonisation.  \\nBusiness \\nBusiness and the environment are closely linked and influence \\neach other. Thus, alongside carbon emissions, resource effi-\\nciency will also gain in importance. The demand for secondary \\nmaterials and recycling is also rising, for instance, due to quota \\nrequirements. Simultaneously, this development is giving rise to \\ncross-industry initiatives and opportunities  for new business \\nmodels. ↗ Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy \\nCompetition among various political systems is a dominating \\nforce in international politics, influencing changes in international \\ntrade flows using instruments like sanctions, tariffs and subsi-\\ndies. The need to secure supply chains is intensifying due to the \\ndual challenges of climate change and geopolitical risks. \\nPolitics \\nPolitics and regulations are narrowing the scope for action across \\nthe entire automotive value creation model. There is an increas-\\ning variety of legislation in all regions of the world.  \\nIn urban areas within the European Union, infrastructure bottle-\\nnecks and selective reallocation of road space are likely to result \\nin increased traffic congestion and reduced accessibility. Simul-\\ntaneously, there is an increasing trend towards policies that dis-\\ncourage car use in city centres. The planned deployment of smart \\ncity technologies would, however, primarily affect cities in China. \\nCORNERSTONES OF THE STRATEGY \\nThe BMW Group’s strategy is oriented to its corporate purpose: \\n“The BMW  Group exists to move body, heart and mind.”  \\nIt is the driving force, the guiding principle and the orientation for \\nour employees, and our commitment to our active role in society. \\nIts long-term focus guides us purposefully through the extensive \\ntransformation of the entire automotive industry and beyond. \\nTransitioning to the specific details of the BMW Group strategy, \\nthe BMW Group Impact broadens the Company’s long-term stra-\\ntegic vision and underscores its ambition to contribute to broader \\nsocietal development. “We make individual mobility more hu-\\nman, intelligent and responsible – creating an inspiring future for \\nall of us.” \\nWith this in mind, the BMW Group’s corporate strategy \\n(BMW Group strategy) defines the strategic framework and lays \\nthe foundation for the Company to maintain a consistent and \\nmarket-oriented focus on profitability, growth and sustainability, \\neven in an increasingly dynamic environment.

It aims to find the right balance be-\\ntween business, the environment and society. The  key areas of \\nfocus within the strategy are electrification, digitalisation and \\nsustainability or circularity. This enables us to seamlessly merge \\nenjoyment and responsibility, without compromising, and to \\nachieve our growth and profitability objectives.  \\nThe BMW Group is committed to the Paris Climate Agreement. \\nTo achieve this, the BMW Group promotes the reduction of car-\\nbon emissions throughout the whole life cycle of its products as \\nwell as the principles of the circular economy with a verifiable \\ntrack record of continuous improvement – from the supply chain \\nto production, the use phase and the recycling of its products. For \\nthis reason, the BMW  Group has laid out measurable, science -\\nbased targets to be reached by 2030; these are firmly estab-\\nlished across the company (base year 2019). Carbon emissions \\nare to be reduced as follows: \\n1. An average of 80% carbon reduction at our own plants \\nand locations (Scope 1 and 2) per vehicle produced \\n(↗ Carbon emissions generated at BMW Group locations) \\n2. Carbon reduction during the vehicle’s use phase (Scope 3 \\ndownstream) by an average of at least 50% per kilometre \\ndriven.

The BMW Group is shap-\\ning the future of sustainable mobility with its passion and strong \\ncapacity for innovation. Thanks to its exciting products, the BMW \\nGroup is able to achieve maximum customer satisfaction and \\nbrand strength, and thus grow its market share. \\nEconomic performance is a very important aspect of our corpo-\\nrate management system and is anchored in our objective of har-\\nnessing growth potential and securing our profitability targets. \\nThis is supported by our ambitious financial standards, which are \\nlinked to the strategic key figures EBIT margin in the Automotive \\nsegment (between 8 and 10%), RoCE in the Automotive seg-\\nment of at least 18% and an EBT margin in the Group of more \\nthan 10%. ↗ Performance Indicators and Performance Management \\nThe quality and reliability of all of our products and services are \\nthe critical drivers for customer satisfaction, enthusiasm and the \\neconomic success of the BMW Group. We are therefore commit-\\nted to a comprehensive approach to quality, centred on deliver-\\ning the best possible customer experience. The “Mission Quality” \\ninitiative was launched across the Company in 2023. As a key \\narea of focus for the Company, the initiative promotes the \\nstrengthening of quality awareness and focuses on the individual \\ncontributions of all employees.  \\nDigitalisation is consistently extended beyond the vehicle \\n↗ Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation, encompassing both \\ncorporate and customer processes, as well as along the automo-\\ntive value chain, enhancing the resilience and business agility of \\nthe BMW Group. There are corresponding initiatives in all  \\nareas of the Company. Our “Digital Process & Impact” initiative \\nis an example of commitment to significantly accelerating the \\ndigitalisation of our internal processes and operations across the \\nCompany, harnessing digital potential in every area through the \\nuse of digitalised process management. The dedicated process \\nand digitalisation functions ensure the consistent implementa-\\ntion and corresponding development of expertise across all de-\\npartments. Concurrently, March 2023 marked the launch of DIG-\\nITAL BOOST, one of the most comprehensive training pro-\\ngramme in the BMW Group’s history. This virtual training pro-\\ngramme, designed for employees in indirect roles across all lev-\\nels of the organisation, delivers insights and opportunities in dig-\\nitalisation on both national and international fronts. The aim is \\nfor all employees to acquire the same basic knowledge of digital-\\nisation, enabling them to identify potential within their own areas \\nof responsibility and harness it for the benefit of the BMW Group. \\n \\nStrategic approach – \\nWhere is the BMW Group heading? \\nThe BMW Group is focused on its customers worldwide and on \\nmeeting their different requirements. It does so by understanding \\nthe needs of its current and future customers and exceeding their \\nexpectations. It combines ground-breaking technologies, emo-\\ntional products and individual customer care to create a unique \\noverall experience. The fields of action electrification, digitalisa-\\ntion and circularity are of particular importance. \\nWe recognised the importance of electromobility early on and \\nhave been working resolutely to accelerate the adoption of all -\\nelectric and connected mobility. By the close of 2023, the  \\nBMW Group had introduced at least one all-electric model across \\nall its brands and segments. In 2023, the extended -wheelbase \\nversion of the iX1 for the Chinese market, the BMW i5* sedan and \\nthe Rolls-Royce Spectre* were launched on the market. In 2023, \\ndeliveries of all- electric automobiles increased by more than \\n74.1%, reaching 375,716 automobiles, up from 215,752 auto-\\nmobiles in 2022. ↗ Electromobility \\nIn 2024, the market will welcome several new additions, includ-\\ning the BMW iX2*, the extended-wheelbase version of the BMW \\ni5 sedan tailored for the Chinese market, the BMW i5 Touring*, \\nthe MINI Cooper SE*, the MINI Countryman SE* and the all-elec-\\ntric MINI Aceman, the brand’s first crossover model. ↗ Automotive \\nsegment The BMW Group expects its attractive product range to \\ndrive another significant increase in the number of all-electric ve-\\nhicles delivered in 2024. With intelligent vehicle architectures \\nand flexible production facilities, the company is well- prepared \\nfor the continued expansion of electromobility. Society’s ac-\\nceptance of electromobility will depend on trends in customer de-\\nmand, regional regulations and the development of a suitable \\nframework, with a particular focus on infrastructure expansion. \\nThe BMW Group is currently planning for all- electric vehicles to \\naccount for more than 50% of all vehicles by 2030.

In an increasingly digital envi-\\nronment with changing customer needs, the Company relies on \\na future-oriented sales structure with a focus on the digitalisation \\nof the customer interface and direct customer access. The aim is \\nto offer the industry’s best premium customer experience. In this \\ncontext, the My BMW App and MINI  App play a significant role \\nwith over 12 million users (as at December 2023). More than \\nthree million customers (as at December 2023) access the apps \\nevery day. Using their smartphones, they interact with their BMW \\nor MINI vehicles, the BMW Group itself and the BMW and MINI \\ndealerships, and also receive personalised offers. The relation-\\nship with the customer thus becomes even closer. \\nThe BMW  Group is decisively and consistently driving forward \\nwith its online sale of vehicles. Customers are free to choose \\nwhether they would like to order their vehicle from agents or \\nonline. They also have the option to seamlessly transition be-\\ntween both worlds.  \\nA central aspect of the revamped sales structure is the transition \\nto direct sales. After the pilot market in South Africa, MINI was \\nthe first Group brand to implement the new sales model in China \\nin March 2023, followed by Europe in January 2024 with Italy, \\nPoland and Sweden. The remaining European countries will \\ntransition over the course of 2024 and 2025 and the BMW brand \\nwill follow suit in Europe in 2026. Going forward, our existing \\ntrading partners will continue in their roles as active commercial \\nintermediaries between the BMW Group and our  \\ncustomers. \\nThe trading partners will be closely involved in the implementa-\\ntion. The new sales structure offers an attractive and sustainable \\nbusiness model for these partners, and they will continue to be \\nthe face for customers in the future, where they can focus on \\nproviding the best advice and support. At the same time, we aim \\nto achieve consistent prices across each sales channel.  \\nBy enabling smooth transitions between physical and digital \\nchannels and launching direct sales, the BMW Group is improv-\\ning direct customer connections – an essential step for providing \\nthe best customer experience ↗ Automotive segment. In the Finan-\\ncial Services segment, we are also continually expanding our ser-\\nvices to include digital and modular services. The aim is for our \\nproducts to be accessible to all customer groups across all chan-\\nnels within our strategic orientation in the Financial Services seg-\\nment. ↗ Financial Services segment. This ensures that our customers \\nreceive personalised offers designed to meet their specific \\nneeds. \\nCircularity is a key focus for the BMW Group in the drive towards \\nmore resource-efficient mobility. The concept revolves around \\nrecycling materials to the fullest extent, ensuring that  resources \\nare utilised sustainably and retain their value over time. This ap-\\nproach opens up a range of opportunities across the entire value \\nchain. Reusing valuable resources reduces our reliance on pri-\\nmary raw materials and their fluctuating prices. Furthermore, the \\nuse of high-quality secondary materials significantly reduces the \\ncarbon footprint of our vehicles. ↗ Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency \\nand Renewable Energy. We aim to progress gradually towards a cir-\\ncular economy, from designing for circularity through to increas-\\ning the use of secondary materials for parts and components and \\nultimately advancing to the recycling of end-of-life vehicles. \\n \\nCollaboration – \\nHow does the BMW Group achieve this?   \\nThe BMW Group constantly strives for the best results, support-\\ning its employees with the discovery and development of their \\npotential so they are able to remain productive. We support and \\nchallenge strong teams with complementary strengths who work \\ntogether to achieve the best solutions in a complex environment. \\nWe see diversity as an important element of our competitiveness. \\n↗ Employees and Society  The diversity metric defines the share of \\nwomen in management positions as a key performance indicator \\nand a strategic target variable. The aim is to increase the share \\nof women in management positions at the BMW  Group to 22% \\nby 2025. ↗ Performance Indicators and Performance Management \\nBMW Group employees not only work closely together within the \\nCompany, but also with external partners. The stable relation-\\nships that have grown in our partner networks over time are \\nbased on the same values as those at the BMW Group. They al-\\nlow us to maximise our effectiveness and work together to lead \\nthe Company to success. Experiences from the crisis years have \\nfurther strengthened these relationships, as exemplified by our \\nsupply chains. ↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network \\nTogether with our cooperation partners, we realise potential by \\naccessing more expertise and improving our profitability and \\ntechnology footprint. In addition to the collaboration with Qual-\\ncomm in the advancement of assisted and automated driving, \\nthe development partnership between the BMW Group and Solid \\nPower, for instance, presents advantages for both compani es. \\nExamples include our Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre \\n(CMCC) in Parsdorf near Munich, where our expertise in design-\\ning and manufacturing solid-state cells is continuously expanded \\nthrough a dedicated prototype line, bringing significant value to \\nour partnership with Solid Power. We continuously expand our \\ncollaborations to unlock additional potential for value creation in \\nthe Group. ↗ Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation \\nThe BMW Group invests in the development of employee skills, \\nwith the view that continuous training guarantees jobs world-\\nwide. ↗ Employees and Society The restructuring of our Munich head-\\nquarters is an example of this commitment. The complete re-\\nstructuring of an entire plant, including combustion engine vehi-\\ncle production, to 100% electromobility, will be implemented by \\n2027 while production is ongoing. The BMW Group is already \\ndesigning and producing electrified drive components for its ex-\\nisting electric vehicles at German facilities in Munich, Dingolfing, \\nLeipzig and Regensburg, as well as in China at the Shenyang lo-\\ncation.

Capital is \\nconsidered to be employed profitably when the amount of profit \\ngenerated on a sustained basis exceeds the cost of equity and \\ndebt capital. This strategy also secures the desired degree of cor-\\nporate autonomy in the long term. \\n \\nThe BMW\\u202fGroup’s performance management system is based \\non a multilayered structure. Operational performance is man-\\naged primarily at segment level. In order to influence long -term \\ncorporate performance, additional performance indicators are \\ntaken into account within the management system at Group \\nlevel. In this context, the value added serves as one of several \\nindicators to measure the contribution made to enterprise value \\nduring the financial year. \\nThis aspiration to add value is measured at both Group and seg-\\nment level by means of the key performance indicators.

This ensures that sustainability issues are sys-\\ntematically integrated in decision-making proce sses and to \\ncompensation at top management levels. As part of the proce-\\ndures for managing sustainability on an integrated basis at cor-\\nporate level, a Group target system has been created, which ap-\\nplies to specific departments. \\nThe BMW\\u202fGroup has set itself the target of decarbonising its \\nvehicle fleet by at least 40% over the entire life cycle by 2030, \\nbased on the reference year 2019. In this context, specific tar-\\ngets have been set for the scopes of the vehicle’s use phase, \\nproduction and supply chain (↗ Position, ↗ Carbon Emissions). This \\nentails setting specific carbon targets for each vehicle project, \\nmanaging them through digital processes and tracking their at-\\ntainment. \\nAn integrated approach to target management ensures that the \\nBMW Group’s vehicle projects make a positive contribution to-\\nwards achieving the sustainability targets that have been set. \\nFurthermore, the BMW Group will consistently increase its use \\nof secondary raw materials. The Group intends to already have \\nmade significant progress by 2025 with the introduction of the \\nfirst X model of the NEUE KLASSE. Non-financial performance \\nindicators such as carbon emissions and, in future, secondary \\nraw materials quotas are therefore key performance indicators \\nfor all new vehicle projects.

Depending on \\nthe business model, the segments are measured on the basis of \\nreturn on total capital or return on equity. \\nReturn on capital employe d (RoCE) is used for the Automotive \\nand Motorcycles segments and return on equity (RoE) for the Fi-\\nnancial Services segment. These indicators combine a wide \\nrange of relevant economic information, such as profitability (re-\\nturn on sales) and capital efficiency (capital turnover) to measure \\nsegment performance and the development of enterprise value. \\nAutomotive segment \\nThe most comprehensive key performance indicator used for the \\nAutomotive segment is RoCE, which provides information on the \\nprofitability of capital employed and business operations. Value \\ndriver analyses are used to interpret the causes of a change in \\nRoCE and derive suitable measures to influence its development. \\nThe capital employed items taken into account reflect the focus \\nof operational segment management. Capital employed is \\ncalculated as the sum of intangible assets, property, plant and \\nequipment and net working capital, the latter comprising inven-\\ntories and trade receivables less trade payables. The amount of \\ncapital employed increased in light of the full consolidation of \\nBMW Brilliance in the BMW Group Financial Statements as at \\n11 February 2022. The increase arose primarily due to the take-\\nover of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as \\nwell as the capitalisation of reacquired rights in conjunction with \\nthe purchase price allocation. The RoCE will be impacted tempo-\\nrarily by the higher capital base as well as the related amortisa-\\ntion expense expected to be recorded. \\nThe strategic target for RoCE is 18%. \\nDue to the special s ignificance of RoCE for the BMW \\u202fGroup, the \\nAutomotive segment is also managed on the basis of  a number \\nof additional key performance indicators that have a significant \\nimpact on RoCE and hence on segment performance. These \\nvalue drivers include deliveries and the operating return on sales \\n(EBIT margin: segment profit before financial result as a percent-\\nage of segment revenues) as a key figure for profitability in the \\nsegment. \\nFurthermore, the Automotive segment manages its compliance \\nwith fleet carbon emissions requirements in regulated markets. \\nThis also includes the share of all-electric automobiles in deliver-\\nies reported since the 2023 financial year.

Group profit/loss before tax pro-\\nvides a comprehensive measure of the Group’s overall corporate \\nperformance after consolidation effects and enables a transpar-\\nent comparison over time. Other key performance indicators at \\nGroup level are the size of the workforce at the year-end as well \\nas the share of women in management positions. By 2025, the \\nBMW Group aims to increase the share of women in manage-\\nment positions to 22%. ↗ Strategy Process \\nThe information provided by these key performance indicators at \\nGroup level is complemented by the two financial performance \\nindicators of pre-tax return on sales and val ue added. Value \\nadded, as a highly aggregated performance indicator, also pro-\\nvides an insight into capital efficiency and the (opportunity) cost \\nof capital required to generate Group profit. A positive value \\nadded means that a return on investment above the cost of cap-\\nital has been achieved. \\nCapital employed comprises the amount of Group equity and \\npension provisions as well as the financial liabilities of the Auto-\\nmotive and Motorcycles segments employed on average at the \\nend of each of the last five quarters. \\nThe earnings amount corresponds to Group profit/loss before \\ntax, adjusted for interest expense incurred in conjunction with the \\npension provisions and on the financial liabilities of the Automo-\\ntive and Motorcycles segments (profit/loss before interest ex-\\npense and tax). The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return \\nexpected by capital providers in return for the capital employed. \\nSince capital employed comprises an equity capital (e.g. share \\ncapital) and a debt capital element (e.g. bonds), the overall cost \\nof capital is determined on the basis of the weighted average \\nrates for equity and debt capital, measured using standard mar-\\nket procedures. The pre-tax average weighted cost of capital for \\nthe BMW Group in 2023 was 12%, unchanged from the previ-\\nous year. \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn order to determine the internal rate of return, risk-adjusted cost \\nof capital rates are based on the average of actual rates in recent \\nyears. In light of the long-term nature of product and investment \\ndecisions, the following internal rates of return ar e used in con-\\njunction with segment management: \\nin %  2023  2022 \\nAutomotive  12.0  12.0 \\nMotorcycles  12.0  12.0 \\nFinancial Services  13.4  13.4 \\n    \\nValue-based management for project decisions \\nOperational business in the Automotive and Motorcycles seg-\\nments is largely shaped by the life-cycle-dependent character of \\ninvestment projects that have a substantial influence on future \\nperformance. Project-related decisions are therefore a crucial el-\\nement of financial management in the BMW Group. Project deci-\\nsions are based on calculations derived from the expected cash \\nflows of each individual project. Calculations are made for the \\ncomplete term of a project, incorporating future years in which \\nthe project is expected to generate cash flows. \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\nProject decisions are taken on the basis of net present value and \\nthe internal rate of return calculated for the project. The net pre-\\nsent value indicates the extent to which the project will be able to \\ngenerate future net cash inflows over and above the cost of cap-\\nital. A project with a positive net present value enhances future \\nvalue added and therefore results in an increase in enterprise \\nvalue. The project’s internal rate of return measures the average \\nreturn on the capital employed in the project. For all project deci-\\nsions, the project criteria and long -term impact on periodic re-\\nsults are measured and incorporated in the long -term Group \\nplan.

According to calculations of the Inter-\\nnational Monetary Fund (IMF), global gross domestic product \\n(GDP) grew by 3.1% in 2023. While the US and China recorded \\nstronger growth than in the previous year, economic growth in \\nEurope weakened. \\nIn the eurozone, growth in 2023 was 0.5% due to high inflation \\nrates and the resulting fall in demand. In Germany, GDP con-\\ntracted by 0.3% as a result of rising prices, declining export de-\\nmand and the low level of investments in light of higher interest \\nrates. In France (+0.9%), Italy (+0.7%) and Spain (+2.5%), eco-\\nnomic growth was more robust. The UK experienced a significant \\nslowdown in growth to 0.1%.  \\nIn the USA, the economy proved very resilient in the face of rising \\ninterest rates and grew by 2.5% in the reporting period. A sus-\\ntained low level of unemployment in combination with rising \\nwages helped boost consumption. In China, the growth rate in \\n2023 stood at 5.2%, slightly higher than the target set by the \\ngovernment. The momentum resulted in particular from catch-\\nup effects following the end of coronavirus lockdowns. \\nThe Japanese economy recovered well during the reporting pe-\\nriod with a growth rate of 1.8%, benefiting from stronger export \\ndemand on the back of the depreciated currency. \\nHigher benchmark interest rates in many markets and a \\nstrong euro \\nAt the beginning of 2023, inflation remained relatively high in a \\nnumber of countries. Only in the second hal f of the year did the \\ninflation rate gradually begin to decline. Therefore, many central \\nbanks continued to pursue their restrictive monetary policies and \\nraise benchmark interest rates.  \\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  '),\n",

(BMW Bril-\\nliance) has been  fully consolidated as a subsidiary since 11 Feb-\\nruary 2022, whereas up to that date, it had been accounted for \\nusing the equity method. Consequently, BMW  Brilliance is in-\\ncluded for the whole of 2023, but only for a proportionate period \\nof the previous year. \\nGroup revenues totalled € 155,498 million in the reporting year \\n(2022: € 142,610 million), representing a solid increase over \\nthe previous year (+9.0%). The main reason for revenue growth \\nwas the higher number of vehicles delivered. Furthermore, fa-\\nvourable product mix effects and the aforementioned full consol-\\nidation of BMW Brilliance contributed to t he year -on-year in-\\ncrease in revenues. Additionally, higher interest rates and in-\\ncome from dealership financing further increased revenues in \\n2023, mainly reflecting the impact of higher inventory levels held \\nby dealerships in light of improved vehicle availability, model \\nchanges and a higher average financing volume per vehicle. \\nReduced intersegment eliminations associated with leasing \\nbusiness had a positive impact on revenues. \\n \\n    \\nThese favourable factors were offset by unfavourable exchange \\nrate effects from the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar which \\nheld down Group revenues. \\nThe year-on-year increase in cost of sales reflected sales volume \\ngrowth as well as higher expenses for materials and warranty \\nobligations. Similarly, cost of sales recorded by BMW Brilliance \\nalso contributed to an increase compared to 2022. Cost of sales \\nin the previous financial year were also additionally negatively \\nimpacted by the first-time full consolidation of BMW  Brilliance. \\nRising interest rates incre ased interest expenses for the Finan-\\ncial Services segment. \\nGroup research and development expenses increased signifi-\\ncantly by 13.8% year on year. Research and development ex-\\npenditure related primarily to the digitalisation and electrification \\nof the vehicle fleet across all model series, as well as the devel-\\nopment of automated driving functions. Further expenditure was \\nincurred for the development of new models, such as the all-elec-\\ntric BMW i5 *, the X3 and X5 and the Rolls -Royce Spectre and \\nNEUE KLASSE models. \\nDue to revenue growth, the research and development expendi-\\nture ratio remained at the same level as one year earlier. \\nSelling and administrative expenses went up slightly by 3.9% \\nyear on year. The rise was due to higher administrative ex-\\npenses, primarily influenced by higher costs for IT projects, nota-\\nbly in connection with the planned switch to direct sales in Eu-\\nrope. The ratio of selling and administrative expenses to reve-\\nnues fell to 7.1% (2022: 7.4%). \\nDepreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment \\nand intangible assets recorded in cost of sales as well as in sell-\\ning and administrative expenses totalled € 8,974 million (2022: \\n€ 8,566 million). \\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses deteri-\\norated year on year. In 2022, other operating income was in-\\ncreased by income arising on the reversal of provisions. \\nDue to the various factors affecting gross profit, as described \\nabove, profit before financial result climbed to € 18,482 million \\n(2022: € 13,999 million; +32.0%). The impact of the previous \\nyear’s first-time full consolidation of BMW Brilliance and lower \\nintersegment eliminations related to leasing business had a par-\\nticularly positive effect on the year-on-year change in gross \\nprofit. \\nThe financial result deteriorated significantly to a net negative \\namount of € 1,386 million (2022: net positive amount of \\n€ 9,510 million). In the previous year, other financial result ben-\\nefitted primarily from the gain of approximately € 7.7 billion aris-\\ning on the remeasurement of the shares already held by the \\nBMW Group prior to the business combination with BMW  Bril-\\nliance. \\nAdditionally, the other financial result was adversely impacted by \\nthe fair value measurement of interest rate hedging transactions, \\nreflecting falling interest rates in the USA, the UK and the euro-\\nzone during the twelve-month period under report. In the previ-\\nous year, the increase in interest rates resulted in  favourable \\nmeasurement effects on interest rate hedging transactions. \\n \\n \\n \\n* ↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures \\nin € million  2023  2022  \\nChange \\nin % \\nManufacturing costs  82,549  76,760  7.5 \\nCost of sales relating to financial services business   27,764  27,517  0.9 \\nthereof interest expense relating to financial services business   3,554  2,114  68.1 \\nResearch and development expenses   7,538  6,624  13.8 \\nthereof amortisation of capitalised development costs   2,387  2,265  5.4 \\nExpenses for service contracts, telematics and roadside assistance   2,780  2,775  0.2 \\nWarranty expenditure  3,782  3,209  17.9 \\nOther cost of sales  1,396  1,157  20.7 \\nCost of sales  125,809  118,042  6.6 \\nBMW Group cost of sales '),\n",

Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statements \\ncorrespond to the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet. \\nCash flows from operating activities are determined indirectly, \\nstarting with Group/segment profit before tax. By contrast, cash \\nflows from investing and financing activities are based on actual \\npayments and receipts. \\nThe lower net cash inflow from operating activities was primarily \\ndue to changes in leased products and receivables from sales \\nfinancing, particularly credit financing for dealerships. The year -\\non-year increase in credit financing for dealerships was driven by \\nimproved vehicle availability, model changes and a higher aver-\\nage financing volume per vehicle. \\nA furt her factor for the decrease in cash inflow from operating \\nactivities was the higher level of inventories held with a view to \\nservicing markets and fulfilling customer demand. A lower in-\\ncrease in receivables and higher payables had a positive impact \\non the cash inflow from operating activities.  \\nThe cash outflow from investing activities was higher than one \\nyear earlier. In 2022, the first-time full consolidation of BMW Bril-\\nliance resulted in a positive impact of € 3,587 million to cash out-\\nflow from investing activities, resulting from cash acquired on the \\nbusiness combination and the purchase price paid. Moreover, in-\\ncreased investments in property, plant and equipment, particu-\\nlarly for introducing new vehicle models, digitalising the fleet as \\nwell as pressing ahead with automated driving and the NEUE \\nKLASSE, resulted in a higher net cash outflow than one year ear-\\nlier.  \\nIn contrast, the net cash inflow arising on the sale of marketable \\nsecurities had a positive impact on cash flows from investing \\nactivities. \\nThe decrease in the net cash outflow from financing activities \\nwas mainly the result of higher borrowings and lower repay-\\nments.  \\nHigher dividend payments to shareholders of BMW AG (2023: \\n€ 5,430 million; 2022: € 3,827 million) increased the net cash \\noutflow from financing activities. \\n \\nFree cash flow for the Au tomotive segment was as follows: \\n \\nin € million 2023 2022 Change \\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from operating activities 17,542 23,523 – 5,981\\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from investing activities – 9,548 –  4,772 –  4,776\\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from financing activities – 6,859 –  17,984 1 1,125 \\nEffects of exchange rate and changes in composition of segment  – 678 9 4 – 772\\nChange in cash and cash equivalents  457 861 – 404\\nin € million 2023 2022 Change \\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from operating activities 17,675 14,782 2,893 \\nCash inflow (+) / outflow (–) from investing activities – 9,373 –  3,179 –  6,194\\nAdjustment for net investment in marketable securities and investment funds  – 1,360 –  532 –  828\\nFree cash flow Automotive segment  6,942 11,071 – 4,129\\nBMW Group cash flows \\nFree cash flow Automotive segment '),\n",

In contrast, the build-\\nup of inventories to service the markets had a negative impact. \\nLiabilities for bonus payments to dealerships went up, partly due \\nto the higher sales volume, and had a positive impact on the cash \\nflow. In addition, the net cash inflow from operating activities rose \\ndue to lower income tax payments. \\nNet financial assets of the Automotive segment decreased year \\non year due to dividend payments and the share buyback pro-\\ngramme.  \\nIn the Automotive segment, net financial assets comprised the \\nfollowing: \\n \\n* Excluding derivative financial instruments. \\nCash and cash equivalents held by the Financial Services seg-\\nment changed as follows: \\n \\nThe lower cash inflow from operating activities of the Financial \\nSe\\nrvices segment was primarily due to changes in leased prod-\\nucts and receivables from sales financing, particularly credit fi-\\nnancing for dealerships.

The funds \\nraised are used almost exclusively to refinance the BMW Group’s \\nFinancial Services business. The overall objective of Group fi-\\nnancing is to ensure the solvency of the BMW Group at all times, \\nfocusing on three areas: \\n1. The ability to act through permanent access to strategically \\nimportant capital markets \\n2. Autonomy through the diversification of refinancing instru-\\nments and investors \\n3. A focus on value through the optimisation of financing costs \\nFinancing measures undertaken at corporate level ensure ac-\\ncess to liquidity for the Group’s operating subsidiaries at stand-\\nard market conditions and consistent credit terms. Funds are ac-\\nquired in line with a target liability structure, comprising a bal-\\nanced mix of financing instruments. The use of longer -term in-\\nstruments to refinance the Group’s Financial Services business \\nand the maintenance of a sufficiently high liquidity reserve serves \\nto rule out any imminent liquidity risk for the portfolio. This con-\\nservative financial approach also has a favourable effect on the \\nGroup’s rating. Further information is provided in the section  \\nLiquidity Risks within the chapter ↗ Risks and Opportunities. \\nFocused capital market management, good ratings and the high \\nlevel of acceptance enjoyed by the BMW Group on those markets \\nenabled it to refinance itself on the world’s debt capital markets \\nat favourable conditions during the 12-month period under re-\\nport. In addition to bonds, the BMW Group also issued commer-\\ncial paper. \\nFurthermore, retail customer and dealership financing receiv -\\nables, rights and obligations from leasing contracts, as well as \\ncollateral interests in the financed vehicles, were transferred to \\nstructured entities that securitise them and place them as collat-\\neralised securities on the capital market as part of the Group’s \\nasset-backed securities financing arrangements (ABS financ-\\ning). \\nSpecific banking instruments, such as the customer deposits \\nused by the Group’s own banks in Germany and the USA, were \\nalso deployed for financing purposes. In addition, loans were \\ntaken from international banks. \\nDuring the reporting period, the BMW Group issued bonds total-\\nling approximately € 9.2 billion. The Group refinanced itself by \\nmeans of 144A transactions with a total volume of 3 billion US \\ndollars on the US capital market and by means of so-called \\nPanda bonds with a volume of 3 billion Chinese renminbi on the \\nChinese capital market. Furthermore, the BMW Group issued, \\namong others, two euro benchmark bonds totalling € 3.0 billion, \\nas well as a pound sterling benchmark bond of 0.4 billion British \\npounds and a Canadian bond of 0.5 billion Canadian dollars on \\nthe international capital markets. ABS transactions with a total \\nfinancing volume equivalent to € 16.0 billion were executed in \\n2023, including both new and rolled -over ABS transactions. \\nDuring the reporting period, ABS financing transactions were \\ncarried out in the following markets: Australia, China, Germany, \\nJapan, Canada, Switzerland, South Korea, the USA and the UK. \\nThe following table provides an overview of amounts utilised at \\n31 December 2023 in connection with the BMW Group’s money \\nand capital market programmes: \\nProgrammes  \\nProgramme \\nvolume  \\nAmount \\nutilised* \\nin € billion     \\nEuro medium-term notes  50.0  22.9 \\nCommercial paper  13.0  3.3 \\n* Measured at the year-end exchange rate. \\nThe BMW  Group continued to deploy robust liquidity -related \\nmeasures throughout 2023 to ensure its ability to act flexibly and \\nindependently at all times.  \\nAs at 31 December 2023, liquidity on hand amounted to € 19.5 \\nbillion, slightly below the previous year’s level (2022: € 20.3 bil-\\nlion). \\nThe BMW  Group also has access to a syndicated credit line, \\nwhich was renewed in June 2023.

The new BMW X5 and BMW X6 \\nflagship models were launched in the spring. The new BMW 5 \\nSeries Sedan followed in autumn. At market launch, all drivetrain \\nvariants were available for this model, including the first all-elec-\\ntric BMW i51, the two PHEV models BMW 530e1 and BMW 550e \\nxDrive1, as well as models powered by conventional combustion \\nengines. The globally popular Business Sedan, which received \\nan overwhelmingly positive response from the international trade \\npress shortly after its launch, will be available on the Chinese \\nmarket from early 2024. In October 2023, the BMW X2 also cel-\\nebrated its world premiere with its first all-electric BMW iX2 1 \\nmodel. The market launch will start in spring 2024. \\nBMW M sets new record \\nBMW M is also on course for growth. With a significant increase \\nof 14.2% to a total of 202,431 units, sales of high-performance \\nautomobiles surpassed the 200,000-mark for the first time \\n(2022: 177,258 units). The positive development is also a result \\nof the electrification of the BMW M model range: the highest-vol-\\nume model was once again the Sports Coupé BMW i4 M501.  \\nThe focus on the electrification of drive systems was also evident \\nin market launches in 2023. Right at the beginning of the year, \\nthe BMW XM1 was launched worldwide as BMW M’s first high -\\nperformance class PHEV. The BMW i7 M70 xDrive1 and BMW i5 \\nM60 xDrive1 models expanded the BMW M portfolio of all -elec-\\ntric high-performance vehicles. \\nThe 2024 model year looks highly promising. Following the suc-\\ncess of the BMW M3 CS1, another special model in the high-per-\\nformance class, the BMW M4 CS, is on the verge of being \\nlaunched. Further updates to the BMW M3, BMW M4 and BMW \\nM2 have already been announced and will be introduced during \\nthe year.

In 2023, it has been included for the full year. \\nAt € 132,277 million (2022: € 123,602 million; + 7.0%, cur-\\nrency-adjusted: +11.3%), the Automotive segment recorded a \\nsolid year-on-year increase in revenues on the back of higher ve-\\nhicle sales. In the previous year, vehicle sales fell due to produc-\\ntion cutbacks caused by the limited availability of semiconductors \\nand wiring harnesses as well as pandemic-related lockdowns in \\nChina. Furthermore, the increased volume of high-revenue mod-\\nels sold, such as the BMW 7 Series and the BMW X5, as well as \\ngrowth in spare parts and accessories business, also contributed \\nto the year-on-year increase in revenues. The full consolidation \\nof BMW Brilliance also increased revenues. Unfavourable cur-\\nrency translation effects, primarily from the Chinese renminbi and \\nthe US dollar, held down the increase in revenues. \\nThe segment’s cost of sales amounted to € 109,920 million and \\nwas therefore moderately higher than the previous year (2022: \\n€ 104,324 million; + 5.4%). Similar to revenue, higher vehicle \\nsales and full consolidation of BMW Brilliance also had an impact \\nin this regard. The segment’s cost of sales was also negatively \\nimpacted by increased expenses for warranties. A higher propor-\\ntion of electrified, especially all-electric, vehicles also contributed \\nto increased costs. \\nIn the previous year, the impact of the full consolidation o f \\nBMW Brilliance, including approximately € 1.8 billion in depreci-\\nation from purchase price allocation and the elimination of ap-\\nproximately € 1.3 billion in intra-group profits, had a negative ef-\\nfect on the cost of sales. Depreciation from the purchase price \\nallocation amounted to approximately € 1.4 billion in 2023.  \\nThe increased research and development expenditure  is primar-\\nily related to the cross-series digitalisation and electrification of \\nthe vehicle fleet, as well as the development of automated driving \\nfunctions. Furthermore, the expenditure resulted from the \\ndevelopment of new models, such as the BMW  5 Series and \\nNEUE KLASSE models, for example. \\nSelling and administrative expenses rose to € 9,195 million in \\nthe reporting period ( 2022: € 8,801 million; + 4.5%). A signifi-\\ncant reason for the increase is higher costs for IT projects.  \\nThe net amount  of other operating income and expenses de-\\ncreased year-on-year. Among other factors, other operating in-\\ncome in the previous year included higher reversals of provisions. \\nAt € 12,981 million, profit before financial result in the 2023 fi-\\nnancial year was significantly higher than in the same period of \\nthe previous year (2022: € 10,635 million; + 22.1%). The full \\nconsolidation of BMW  Brilliance had a dampening impact in \\n2022 in the year-on-year comparison. \\nThe EBIT margin for the segment was at 9.8% for the reporting \\nyear (2022: 8.6%; +1.2 percentage points). As forecasted in the \\nquarterly report for 30 September 2023, the EBIT margin was \\nwithin the range of 9.0 to 10.5%. \\nThe financial result of the Automotive segment was a net nega-\\ntive amount of € 339 million and therefore significantly down on \\nthe previous year’s corresponding figure (2022: net positive  \\n \\namount of € 8,283 million). The main reason for the year -on-\\nyear deterioration was the gain of €  7.7 billion recognised in \\n2022 in other financial result arising on the remeasurement of \\nthe segment’s previous at-equity interest in BMW Brilliance.  \\nIn the year under report, the interest result was primarily im-\\npacted by higher expenses arising from the unwinding of interest \\non discounted provisions, while interest income from bank de-\\nposits had an offsetting effect. In the previous year, interest in-\\ncome arising from the change in interest rates in connection with \\nthe unwinding of interest on discounted provisions was reported \\nwithin interest and similar expenses.  \\nAt € 12,642 million, profit before tax for the financial year 2023 \\nwas significantly down on the previous year (2022: \\n€ 18,918 million), whereby the decrease was primarily due to \\nthe gain of € 7.7 billion recognised in other financial result in \\n2022 arising on the remeasurement of the segment’s previous \\nat-equity interest in BMW Brilliance. \\nThe Automotive segment’s return on capital emp loyed (RoCE) \\nfor 2023 finished at 20.2%, and was therefore within the pre-\\ndicted target range of 18 to 22% (2022: 18.1%; +2.1 percent-\\nage points).

Sales in China in-\\ncreased slightly to 15,832 units (2022: 15,404 units; +2.8%). \\nMarket launches in the reporting year \\nIn 2023, BMW  Motorrad celebrated its c entenary and took the \\nopportunity not only to renew but also expand its product portfo-\\nlio in the premium segment. The BMW R 1300 GS was intro-\\nduced as the highlight and start of the renewal of the legendary \\nGS Boxer family and has been available to customers since No-\\nvember 2023. \\nIn the first half of the year, three model updates were introduced \\nin the Sport and Super Sport segment with the R 1250 RS, the S \\n1000 RR and their high-performance M variant – the M 1000 \\nRR. The R 1250 R was updated within the Roadster lineup. The \\nM 1000 R, the first M Roadster, took to the roads as a completely \\nnew model. The centenary celebrations were complemented in \\nthe Heritage segment by two exclusive edition models: the BMW \\nR 18 100 Years and the BMW R nineT 100 Years.

In a year-on-\\nyear comparison, net interest expense of € 1 million in 2023 had \\na negative impact on the financial result (2022: net interest in-\\ncome of € 12 million). In the previous year, interest income aris-\\ning from the change in interest rates in connection with the un-\\nwinding of interest on discounted provisions was reported within \\ninterest and similar expenses. In contrast, decreasing interest \\nrates had a negative impact in 2023. \\nThe return on capital employed (RoCE) in the Motorcycles seg-\\nment for the reporting year came in at 22.1%, and was therefore \\nwithin the expected target range of 21 to 26% (2022: 24.9%; -\\n2.8 percentage points). The primary factor for the year -on-year \\nchange was the rise in net working capital, driven by a number of \\nfactors, including the model update in 2023 and a moderate in-\\ncrease in inventory levels. \\nFINANCIAL SERV IC ES SEGMENT  \\nFinancial Services segment earnings down on previous year \\nProfit before tax reported by the Financial Services segment for \\nthe financial year 2023 amounted to € 2,962 million ( 2022: \\n€ 3,205 million; -7.6%) and was therefore moderately down on \\nthe previous year. Key reasons for the decrease were higher re-\\nfinancing costs due to rising interest rates and a decrease in the \\ncontract portfolio. Remarketing revenues from lease returns re-\\nmained at a high level, but were nevertheless below the previous \\nyear’s figure. This also had a negative impact on earnings com-\\npared to the previous year. On the other hand, a lower expense \\nfor credit risk provisioning had a positive effect on earnings. In \\nthe previous year, the level of expense recognised in connection \\nwith credit risk provisioning was heavily influenced by geopolitical \\nuncertainties and a weaker macroeconomic outlook. \\nThe credit loss ratio for the e ntire credit portfolio remained at a \\nlow level in 2023, finishing at 0.18% for the year (2022: 0.13%). \\nIn balance sheet terms, business volume increased slightly to \\nstand at € 137,910 million (2022: € 135,689 million; +1.6%). \\nStable earnings performance by Financial Services segment \\nReturn on equity for the Financial Services segment remained at \\na similar level to the previous year, finishing at 17.2% for the fi-\\nnancial year 2023 (2022: 17.9%; -0.7 percentage points). Re-\\nturn on equity for 2023 was therefore within the revised target \\nrange of between 16 and 19%.  \\nNew business with retail customers in line with last year’s \\nlevel \\nCredit financing and leasing business with retail customers re-\\nmained at the same level in 2013, with a total of 1,542,514 new \\ncontracts concluded (2022: 1,545,490 contracts; -0.2%). Out of \\nthe new contracts concluded in 2023, 325,320 contracts (2022: \\n321,535 contracts; +1.2%) related to credit financing and leas-\\ning of pre-owned BMW Group vehicles. \\n \\n \\nNew lease business grew by 8.5 % increase in 2023, whereas \\ncredit financing business contracted by 4.1%.

The Financial Statements of \\nBMW AG are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the \\nGerman Commercial Code (HGB) and the relevant supplemen-\\ntary requirements contained in the German Stock Corporation \\nAct (AktG).  \\nThe key financial performance indicator for BMW AG is the divi-\\ndend payout ratio. This is defined as the unappropriated profit of \\nBMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to the Group net \\nprofit attributable to shareholders of BMW AG in accordance with \\nIFRS. The key non -financial performance indicators are essen-\\ntially identical and concurrent with those of the BMW Group. \\nThese are described \\nin detail in the ↗ Financial Performance section \\nof the Combined Management Report.  \\nDifferences in accounting treatments based on HGB (used for \\nthe Company Financial Statements) and IFRS (used for the \\nGroup Financial Statements) are mainly to be found in connec-\\ntion with the capitalisation of intangible assets, the creation of \\nvaluation units, the recognition and measurement of financial in-\\nstruments and provisions as well as the recognition of deferred \\ntax assets. Differences also arise in the presentation of assets \\nand liabilities and of items in the income statement. \\nBusiness environment and review of operations \\nThe general and sector -specific environment of BMW  AG is es-\\nsentially the same as that of the BMW Group and is described in \\nthe ↗ Financial Performance section of the Combined Managemen t \\nReport.  \\nBMW AG develops, manufactures  and sells automobiles and \\nmotorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories manufac-\\ntured in-house, by foreign subsidiaries and by external suppliers, \\nand performs services related to these products. Sales activities \\nare carried out primarily through branches, subsidiaries, inde-\\npendent dealerships and importers. Automobile deliveries in-\\ncreased by 235,621 to 2,620,920 units in the financial year \\n2023. This figure includes 692,267 units relating to series sets \\nsupplied to BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, an in-\\ncrease of 50,473 units compared with the previous year.  \\nAs of 31 December 2023, BMW  AG had 85,168 employees, \\nplus 5,733 apprentices, interns and thesis students (31 Decem-\\nber 2022 81,683 employees, plus 5,500 apprentices, interns \\nand thesis students). \\nThe year 2023 was characterised by a volatile business environ-\\nment marked by increasing (geo-)political tensions. In ad dition, \\nin many markets higher inflation rates accompanied by increased \\ninterest rates had a negative impact on the consumer climate. \\nDespite these factors, BMW AG overall looks back on a positive \\nbusiness performance in the reporting year. \\nBMW AG’s solid financial condition is reflected in the results of \\noperations, financial position and net assets reported for the fi-\\nnancial year 2023.

Price and product mix effects, along with increased \\nsales volume, had a positive impact on revenue growth. Ex-\\nchange rate factors also had a positive effect on revenues. Geo-\\ngraphically, the increase in revenues was mainly attributable to \\nEurope and Asia. Revenues totalled € 107,874 million (2022:  \\n€ 98,807 million), of which Group internal revenues accounte d \\nfor € 83,231 million (2022: € 77,843 million) or 77.2% (2022: \\n78.8%). \\nProduction costs went up by € 9,212 million to € 90,865 million, \\nmostly due to higher costs for materials and logistics. \\nGross profit decreased by € 145 million to € 17,009 million. \\nOverall, selling expenses increased slightly, while general admin-\\nistrative costs increased substantially. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n* ↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures \\nA large proportion of research and development expenses was \\nrelated to new vehicle models, including the all -electric \\nBMW i5* and Rolls Royce Spectre * models and the electrified \\nBMW 5 Series, BMW X3 and BMW X5 models, as well as the \\ndevelopment of digital products, automated driving and the \\nNEUE KLASSE. In line with the ramp-up of vehicles and the ex-\\npenses for platforms related to the transformation towards \\nelectromobility, research and devel opment costs increased by \\n2.1% compared to the previous year. \\nOther operating income was reduced to € 1,872 million (2022: \\n€ 2,529 million).The change was mainly due to lower reversals \\nof other provisions and lower income from financial transac-\\ntions. \\nOther operating expenses decreased to € 2,067 million (2022: \\n€ 2,889 million) and, as in the previous year, mainly include d \\nexpenses from financial transactions and additions to other \\nprovisions. \\nIncome from profit and loss transfer agreements with Group \\ncompanies, reported in the line item Result on investments, de-\\ncreased significantly. This was essentially due to the decrease \\nin the profit of BMW  INTEC Beteiliungs GmbH, Munich, which, \\namong other things, received lower distributions. \\nThe financial result improved by €  2,842 million compared to \\nthe previous year. The previous year mainly included higher ex-\\npenses from the the fair value measurement of plan assets off-\\nset against pension obligations. \\nTaxes on income resulted primarily from the current tax calcu-\\nlation for the financial year.

This involves con-\\ncentrating a significant part of the Group’s liquidity at the level of \\nBMW AG. An important instrument in this context is the cash pool \\nbased at BMW AG. \\nCash and cash equivalents decreased slightly by €  62 million to \\n€ 6,145 million due to outflows from investing and financing  \\nactivities. This was offset by the surplus from operating activities.  \\nEquity fell by € 2,286 million to € 17,932 million, mainly due to \\nlower unappropriated profit and lower retained earnings as a re-\\nsult of the share buyback programmes. The equity ratio changed \\nfrom 28.0% to 26.4%. \\nIn order to secure pension obligations, cash funds totalling € 430 \\nmillion were transferred to BMW Trust e. V., Munich, in conjunc-\\ntion with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA), to be invested \\nin plan assets. Plan assets are offset against the related guaran-\\nteed obligations.  \\nAfter offsetting pension plan assets against pension obligations, \\nprovisions for pensions decreased from € 2,871 million to  \\n€ 2,231 million. \\nOther provisions decreased from €  11,686 million to € 11,537 \\nmillion mainly due to a decline in provisions for taxes and provi-\\nsions for liability risks. Conversely, the provision for statutory and \\nnon-statutory warranty and product guarantee obligations in-\\ncreased. \\nThe decrease in liabilities to subsidiaries to € 22,648 million \\n(2022: € 25,703 million) was mainly due to the decline in finan-\\ncial liabilities. \\nDeferred income went up by € 450 million to € 4,501 million and \\nincluded primarily amounts for services still to be performed re-\\nlating to service and maintenance contracts. \\nRisks and opportunities \\nBMW AG's performance is essentially dependent on the same \\nset of risks and opportunities that affect the BMW Group and \\nwhich are described in detail in the ↗ Risks and Opportunities chapter \\nof the Combined Management Report. As a general rule, BMW \\nAG participates in the risks entered into by Group companies in \\nproportion to the respective shareholding percentage. At the \\nsame time, the result on investments has a significant impact on \\nthe earnings of BMW AG. \\nBMW AG is integrated in the Group-wide risk management sys-\\ntem and internal control system of the BMW Gro up. Further in-\\nformation is provided in the ↗ Internal Control System chapter of the \\nCombined Management Report. \\nOutlook \\nFor the financial year 2024, BMW AG expects an unchanged div-\\nidend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accord-\\nance with HGB in relation to the Group net profit attributable to \\nshareholders of BMW AG in accordance with IFRS), and there-\\nfore within the targeted range of between 30 and 40% (2023: \\n33.7%). \\nDue to its significance in the Group and its close ties with Group \\ncompanies, expectations for BMW AG with respect to its non -fi-\\nnancial performance indicators correspond largely to the BMW \\nGroup's outlook. This is described in detail in the ↗ Outlook chapter \\nof the Combined Management Report. \\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtscha ftsprüfungsgesell-\\nschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has issued an unqual-\\nified audit opinion on the Company Financial Statements of BMW \\nAG, of which the balance sheet and the income statement are \\npresented here.

It aims to channel capital flows towards envi-\\nronmentally sustainable economic activities. \\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system that defines eco-\\nnomic activities as environmentally sustainable based on fulfil-\\nment of predetermined technical screening criteria. \\nEssentially, an economic activity can only be classified as sus-\\ntainable if it substantially contributes to one of the following six \\nenvironmental objectives: \\nI. Climate change mitigation \\nII. Climate change adaptation \\nIII. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine re-\\nsources \\nIV. Transition to a circular economy \\nV. Pollution prevention and control \\nVI. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems \\nThis contribution is based on fulfilment of specific predetermined \\nrequirements. Moreover, no other environmental objective may \\nbe significantly harmed during performance of the activity and \\nthe company involved must observe minimum safeguards, \\namong them compliance with human rights. \\nIn the previous year, the BMW Group reported on the Taxonomy-\\neligible and Taxonomy-aligned proportion of its revenues, capital \\nexpenditure and operating expenditure for Environmental Objec-\\ntives I and II.1 From reporting year 2023 on, the BMW Group is \\nalso required to report on the proportion of Taxonomy -eligible \\nrevenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure for \\nEnvironmental Objectives III to VI for the first time, following the \\nnew Delegated Regulation 2023/2486. New activities for Envi-\\nronmental Objectives I and II are set out by Delegated Regulation \\n2023/2485. The BMW Group will be required to report on Tax-\\nonomy alignment for all environmental objectives from reporting \\nyear 2024 onwards. \\nOur holistic understanding of sustainability \\nThe BMW Group supports the overarching goal of the EU Tax-\\nonomy to promote the private financing of environmentally sus-\\ntainable economic activities in order to make Europe the world’s \\nfirst climate-neutral continent by 2050. As a company aspiring \\nto achieve ↗ Net zero across its entire value chain2 by no later than \\n2050, the BMW  Group had already set ambitious, science -\\nbased targets for all three scopes in 2020, which it aims to \\nachieve by 2030 (base year 2019). These goals were validated \\nby the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Each year, the \\nBMW Group informs about the actual level of progress. ↗ The BMW \\nGroup Strategy \\nIn the coming years, as a result of the significant increase in elec-\\ntric mobility, the majority of carbon emissions will no longer be \\ngenerated primarily in the use phase, but in the upstream value \\nchain. Without the planned set of measures to reduce carbon \\nemissions generated within the BMW Group supply chain, these \\nemissions (Scope 3 upstream) would already exceed actual car-\\nbon emissions in the use phase prior to 2030 (Scope 3 down-\\nstream) ↗ The BMW Group Strategy , ↗ Production and Supplier Network , \\n↗ Carbon Emissions. Accordingly, the BMW Group is taking a holistic \\napproach to achieving its sustainability- related targets and is \\ncommitted to considering ↗ Carbon Emissions over the entire life cy-\\ncle. Among other things, the BMW Group’s measures include a \\nfurther reduction in energy demand, increased use of renewable \\nenergy (Scope 1 and 2), the use of new, efficiency-increasing \\ntechnologies (Scope 3 downstream), the use of green electricity \\nas a criterion when awarding contracts to suppliers and a contin-\\nuously increasing secondary raw material quota (Scope 3 up-\\nstream). However, for the economic activities that are relevant to \\nthe BMW Group, the EU Taxonomy focuses exclusively on reduc-\\ning carbon emissions during the use phase that are attributable \\nto low-emissions (until 2025) and emissions-free drivetrains. In-\\ndirect carbon emissions, for instance those produced when gen-\\nerating charging current or during the energy -intensive produc-\\ntion of high -voltage batteries, are not taken into account in the \\ncontext of these economic activities. Moreover, the EU Taxon-\\nomy only reflects the impact of decarbonisation measures on in-\\nhouse production to the extent that  they serve to manufacture \\nTaxonomy-aligned products or to the extent that they are explic-\\nitly included in the description of an activity. For example, in-\\ncreasing the energy efficiency of paint shop processes also re-\\nduces carbon emissions in in-house production when an internal \\ncombustion engine vehicle is painted. The BMW  Group’s sus-\\ntainability efforts in this regard is not or only partially taken into \\naccount as part of currently defined economic activities in the EU \\nTaxonomy. ↗ Carbon Emissions \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1The definition of the three performance indicators and their differentiation from IFRS can be found \\nin the ↗ Glossary. \\n2 In this context the entire value chain is to be understood as Scope 1 and 2 as well as the Scope 3 \\ncategories applicable to the BMW Group (categories 1, 4 and 11) in accordance with the Green-\\nhouse Gas Protocol. \\nEU TAXONOMY  '),\n",

Economic activity \\nCCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 both make a substantial \\ncontribution to Environmental Objective I “Climate change miti-\\ngation” due to the manufacture as well as financing and leasing \\nof low-emission (PHEV < 50 g CO 2/km WLTP by 2025) and \\nzero-emission vehicles (BEV and motorcycles with 0 g CO2/km). \\nEconomic activity CCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 as un-\\ndertaken by the BMW Group are also described under Environ-\\nmental Objective II “Climate change adaptation”. There are, \\nhowever, no identifiable values that can be separated from Envi-\\nronmental Objective I “Climate change mitigation”.1 \\nIn order t o identify the specific carbon emissions of PHEV that \\nare not determined in line with Regulation (EU) 2019/631 \\n(among others, USA and China), assumptions were made based \\non the worst-case value for that vehicle model, even though \\nthese emissions may have been lower in reality. \\nDo no significant harm \\nCompliance with the DNSH criteria was reviewed in the reporting \\nyear for the five additional environmental objectives, based in \\neach case on the specific requirements for economic activity CCM \\n3.3 “Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport” and \\neconomic activity CCM 6.5 “Transport by motorbikes, passenger \\ncars and light commercial vehicles”. \\nThe vehicle portfolio for economic activity CCM 6.5 includes \\nBMW Group vehicles and vehicles from other manufacturers. As \\nno data are available regarding the relevant attributes of these \\nthird-party products, it is currently not possible to make a com-\\nprehensive assessment in relation to the DNSH criteria. For this \\nreason, these vehicles are currently not reported as Taxonomy-\\naligned. \\nClimate change adaptation \\nA robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment is required for \\nboth economic activity CCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 \\nto determine that they do not cause significant harm to Environ-\\nmental Objective II. To satisfy this requirement, the physical cli-\\nmate risks at all key BMW Group production sites are considered \\nand an assessment of any damage that may occur as a result of \\nclimate change is being carried out based on long-term climate \\nprojection scenarios2 up to 2035 and 2050. Moreover, we con-\\nsider potential natural hazards at all of our direct supplier loca-\\ntions in order to adequately take supply risks into account when \\nselecting and evaluating suppliers. Adaptive solutions to mitigate \\nrisks are drawn up and implemented as appropriate based on \\nthe results of this risk analysis and in consultation with site rep-\\nresentatives. For further information, see ↗ Climate-related Risks and \\nOpportunities. \\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective II are ful-\\nfilled for economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5. \\nSustainable use and protection of \\nwater and marine resources and \\nprotection and restoration of \\nbiodiversity and ecosystems \\nIn order to establish that no significant harm is caused to Envi-\\nronmental Objectives III and VI, it is necessary to perform a com-\\nprehensive risk analysis that looks at the preservation and pro-\\ntection of environmental, water and marine resources for eco-\\nnomic activity CCM 3.3 (in both cases, not relevant for economic \\nactivity CCM 6.5). \\nIn this context, the BMW Group carries out environmental impact \\nassessments in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU during \\nthe construction of new and expansion of existing sites within the \\nEU that also take account of water and biodiversity. At locations \\noutside the EU, the BMW Group carries out an environmental im-\\npact assessment based on EU requirements. Moreover, a certi-\\nfied environmental management system pursuant to ISO 14001 \\nhas been implemented at all BMW Group production sites and all \\nlocal statutory requirements are met. ↗ Resource Management at all \\nlocations \\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objectives III and VI \\nare fulfilled for economic activity CCM 3.3. \\nTransition to a circular economy \\nThe requirements for both economic activities of the BMW Group \\nto do no significant harm to Environmental Objective IV differ for \\neach stage of the value chain. We fulfil these requirements during \\nthe manufacturing process for BMW Group vehicles (economic \\nactivity CCM 3.3) by, for example, using secondary raw materials \\nin our products, designing products to facilitate their recycling, \\nmanaging waste at our production sites in a way that prioritises \\nrecycling over disposal, and systematically registering sub-\\nstances of concern along the entire supply chain. With regard to \\nthe use phase and recycling of BMW Group vehicles (economic \\nactivity CCM 6.5), we have set up appropriate processes to com-\\nply with recycling requirements and established measures for \\nmanaging waste during maintenance and at the end of the life \\ncycle. All these criteria also form part of our comprehensive ap-\\nproach to the ↗ Transition to a circular economy. \\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective IV are ful-\\nfilled for economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5. \\n1 The end-of-lease business for BEV previously included in economic activity CCM 6.5 is now re-\\nported under economic activity CE 5.4 following the redefinition of this activity. \\n2 SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5.

All substances \\nused by the BMW Group are in compliance with national and Eu-\\nropean laws. Substitutes are sought for hazardous substances \\nthat are categorised as being of very high concern in accordance \\nwith Article 57 and 59 of the REACH Regulation, if they are used \\ndirectly or in a proportion exceeding 0.1% weight by weight in a \\nmixture in the production processes of the BMW Group and are \\nconsequently contained in the products of the BMW Group, while \\ntaking factors such as economic and technical requirements into \\naccount. If the use of these hazardous substances cannot be \\navoided, the BMW Group uses them under controlled conditions \\nin accordance with hazardous material regulations. \\nOn the other hand, it is not possible to meet all criteria to do no \\nsignificant harm to Environmental Objective V in the case of eco-\\nnomic activity CCM 6.5. Current PHEV models with air pollutant \\nemissions under 50 \\u2009g CO2/km WLTP offered by the BMW Group \\nand other manufacturers may make a substantial contribution as \\ndefined by the EU Taxonomy. However, manufacturer specifica-\\ntions for air pollutant emissions in real driving conditions (real \\ndriving emissions, RDE) can only be reduced for selected models \\nto 80% of the limit as required by the EU Taxonomy with refer-\\nence to table 2 in the annex to the Clean Vehicles Directive, due \\nto potentially extreme driving situations. The vast majority of \\nPHEV in the vehicle portfolio for economic activity CCM 6.5 must \\ntherefore be considered not Taxonomy-aligned, even if they \\nmeet these values in everyday driving situations. \\nFor the remaining PHEV and BEV models in  the BMW Group’s \\nvehicle portfolio, further deductions have to be made for individ-\\nual models in the context of economic activity CCM 6.5 in light of \\nthe requirements for rolling resistance coefficients for tyres and \\nin particular the external rolling noise of tyres. Owing to the lim-\\nited availability of data, the eligibility of the models concerned is \\ncalculated in a simplified manner based on the tyres approved \\nfor these models, weighted by their purchase volumes and take \\nrates. \\nThe DNSH requirements for En vironmental Objective V are ful-\\nfilled for economic activity CCM 3.3; however, not all are fulfilled \\nfor economic activity CCM 6.5, owing to the RDE and tyre label \\nrequirements described. \\nMinimum safeguards \\nAdditionally, companies that carry out economic activities as de-\\nfined by the EU Taxonomy are required to establish minimum \\nsafeguards. These require the implementation of processes to \\nensure compliance with due diligence obligations both within an \\norganisation and in stages of the upstream and downstream \\nvalue chain that have been outsourced. Specifically, this refers to \\ncompliance with human rights and topics like bribery, corruption, \\ntaxation and fair competition. In its ↗ Policy statement on respect for \\nhuman rights and corresponding environmental standards, the BMW Group \\nhas, among other things, committed to compliance with the fol-\\nlowing standards for minimum safeguards as defined in Arti-\\ncle 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation: Organization for Economic \\nCooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multin a-\\ntional Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and \\nHuman Rights and the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, \\nwhich we signed back in 2001. ↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network , \\n↗ Compliance and Human Rights \\nThe minimum safeguard requirements are met. \\nEU Taxonomy performance indicators \\nPlease refer to the remarks in the glossary for the definition and \\ncalculation of the Taxonomy-specific performance indicators rev-\\nenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure and their \\ndifferentiation from IFRS. ↗ Glossary \\nThe proportion of total revenues, capital expenditure and oper-\\nating expenditure relating to eligible and non-eligible economic \\nactivities are shown in each case as an aggregate percentage for \\nthe BMW Group. All Taxonomy- eligible revenues,  capital ex-\\npenditure and operating expenditure for economic activities CCM \\n3.3 and CCM 6.5 are disclosed under Environmental Objective I \\n“Climate change mitigation”, given that there are no identifiable \\nvalues for Environmental Objective II “Climate change adapta-\\ntion” that can be separated from Environmental Objective I “Cli-\\nmate change mitigation”. This approach avoids double counting \\nof revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure when \\ndetermining the KPI in the numerator across multiple economic \\nactivities. \\nIn the case of capital expenditure and operating expenditure, all \\nTaxonomy-eligible expenditure is allocated to the two economic \\nactivities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5. There is no separable Taxon-\\nomy-eligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure for \\neconomic activity CE 5.4.  \\nIn most cases, values from financial data were allocated directly \\nto the economic activities for all three performance indicators, \\nbased for example on the drivetrain or the vehicle model. In the \\nremaining cases, an allocation mechanism was used for each \\neconomic activity and each performance indicator. For Taxon-\\nomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure for eco-\\nnomic activity CCM 3.3, the allocator is based on long-term Tax-\\nonomy-aligned revenues generated f rom the Automotive and \\nMotorcycles segment: \\n― Allocator for economic activity CCM 3.3: Proportion (BEV + \\nPHEV [<50 g CO2]) x Automotive segment revenues \\n(2024–2029)* \\nThe allocator is based on detailed long-term corporate planning \\nfor the next six years, as approved each year by the Board of \\nManagement and Supervisory Board. It is used for capital \\nexpenditure on property, plant and equipment (including right-of-\\nuse assets from lessee relationships), intangible assets and \\nexpenditure on research and development for economic activity \\nCCM 3.3. For operating expenditure, the allocator is only applied \\nto non-capitalised development costs. \\n* PHEV volumes are only taken into account in the allocator until reporting year 2025 inclusive.

Regardless of the Taxonomy require-\\nments, the BMW Group regularly and comprehensively ad-\\ndresses risks arising from climate change and their potential im-\\npact on its sites and supply chains. ↗ DNSH adaptation to climate \\nchange, ↗ TCFD climate risks \\n― BMW Group perspective \\nAll three performance indicators have grown markedly on \\nthe previous year at BMW Group level, highlighting that the \\nBMW Group is on the right track with its sustainable eco-\\nnomic activities relating to the EU Taxonomy. \\nTaxonomy-aligned revenues of the BMW Group amounted \\nto € 23,690 million (2022: € 15,705 million), correspond-\\ning to 15% of total Group revenues and an increase on the \\nprevious year of four percentage points. The Taxonomy-\\naligned share of capital expenditure was 26% (€ 7,926 mil-\\nlion), which corresponds to an increase of almost five per-\\ncentage points on 2022. Taxonomy-aligned capital ex-\\npenditure as a proportion of the BMW Group’s total capital \\nexpenditure is impacted significantly by additions related to \\nleased products. Consequently, an examination of the pro-\\nportion of Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure at BMW \\nGroup level does not reflect the huge investment in sustain-\\nable economic activities and products. Operating expendi-\\nture incurred for Taxonomy-aligned economic activities \\namounted to € 2,051 million, corresponding to over 31% of \\nTaxonomy-eligible operating expenditu re (2022: 29%). \\n↗ Voluntary additional information on the Taxonomy -aligned share per \\neconomic activity \\n― Economic activity CCM 3.3, “Manufacture of low-carbon \\ntechnologies for transport” \\nThe Taxonomy-aligned share of revenues generated by the \\nAutomotive and Motorcycles segment corresponded to \\n15.0% (economic activity CCM 3.3 “Manufacture of low-\\ncarbon technologies for transport”) of total Group revenues \\n(2022: 10.7%). As a percentage of third-party revenues of \\nthe two segments, the Taxonomy- aligned share rose  to \\n22.1% (2022: 15.7%). As a result, revenues from the Au-\\ntomotive and Motorcycles segment that are associated with \\nthe manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport \\n(CCM 3.3) increased by approximately 41%. In contrast to \\nthe previous year, revenues from pre-owned vehicles in the \\nAutomotive segment are reported under the new economic \\nactivity CE 5.4, somewhat dampening the rise in Taxonomy-\\naligned revenues. ↗ Segment information \\nThe Taxonomy-aligned proportion of capital expenditure in \\nthe Automotive and Motorcycles segment rose to 22.7% \\nfrom 19.1% in the previous year. Looking only at the Tax-\\nonomy-aligned additions to intangible assets and property, \\nplant and equipment in the context of additions recorded by \\nthe Automotive and Motorcycles segment, however, gives \\nrise to a considerably higher proportion of Taxonomy-\\naligned capital expenditure of more than 60%. Segment-\\nspecific capital expenditure is thus around 17 percentage \\npoints higher than in the previous year. This was driven by \\nincreased investment in sustainable products and plant in-\\nfrastructure as part of electrification. This underscores the \\nBMW Group’s extensive capital expenditure on sustainable \\nproducts and technologies. ↗ Voluntary additional information on \\nthe Taxonomy-aligned share per economic activity \\n― Economic activity CCM 6.5, “Transport by motorbikes, \\npassenger cars and light commercial vehicles” \\nThe Taxonomy-aligned shares for the three performance in-\\ndicators are at a low single-digit level for the Financial Ser-\\nvices segment. This is due to the fact that there is a time lag \\nbefore the effects of the ve hicle fleet electrification ramp-up \\nare reflected in the financing and leasing lines of business. \\nA further r eason is the varied, stricter DNSH requirements \\nfor economic activity CCM 6.5, in particular those relat ing to \\nEnvironmental Objective V “ Pollution p revention a nd con-\\ntrol”, which lead to the exclusion of almost all PHEV and a \\nsignificant restriction in the recognition of BEV (for details \\nsee section ↗ Do no significant harm). Third-party brands are \\nnot included in the vehicle portfolio in the reporting on Tax-\\nonomy alignment for economic activity CCM 6. 5. A la ck of \\navailable data regarding the tyre categories or WLTP emis-\\nsions values of th ird-party products makes it impossible to \\nreview compliance with the DNSH criteria in full. Moreover, \\nrev\\nenues from the sale of l ease returns are reported under \\nthe new economic activity CE 5.4, differently from the previ-\\nous ye ar. The Financial S ervices s egm ent recorded a d e-\\ncline in r evenues for 2023 in a bsolute te rms following the \\nreallocation of revenue components to the new economic \\nactivity CE 5.4. The Taxonomy-aligned proportion of capital \\nexpenditure in the Financial Services segm ent rose by more \\nthan 50% on the previous year to 3.3% (€ 1,018 million). \\nBased on total capital expenditure in the Financial Services \\nsegment, the Taxonomy-aligned proportion rose by signifi-\\ncan\\ntly more than 40% to 5.4%. ↗ Voluntary additional information \\non the Taxonomy-aligned share per economic activity \\n― Economic activity CE 5.4, “Sale of second-hand goods” \\nAs stipulated by Delegated Regulation 2023/2486, the \\nBMW Group only reports on the Taxonomy- eligible propor-\\ntion of revenues for economic activity CE 5.4. This economic \\nactivity includes revenues from pre-owned vehicles in the \\nAutomotive segment and revenues from the sale of used \\ncars after their intended use by clients in the Financial Ser-\\nvices segment, but does not include revenues from the sale \\nof used motorcycles. Around 12% of total revenues are \\nTaxonomy-eligible in reporting year 2023. '),\n",

The driver interacts \\nwith the vehicle via the BMW Panoramic Vision, the central dis-\\nplay unit and multifunctional buttons on the steering wheel. The \\nuser experience is complemented by the tried-and-tested voice \\ncontrol system via the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The \\nnext generation of the BMW iDrive thus offers a modern interpre-\\ntation of the brand’s typical driver-oriented focus. Similar to the \\nBMW iDrive controller that was formerly on the centre console or \\nthe BMW head -up display, the brand is setting new standards \\nwith the BMW Panoramic Vision, which will be available for the \\nfirst time in the NEUE KLASSE. It projects information at a height \\nideally aligned with the driver's line of sight and, for the first time, \\nacross the entire width of the windscreen. This innovation will \\ncomplement the enhanced BMW head-up display in the NEUE \\nKLASSE series models. \\nThe BMW VISION Neue Klasse is also characterised by the in-\\ncreased use of secondary raw materials, resource-friendly pro-\\nduction methods and an electric drive system featuring sixth-\\ngeneration BMW eDrive technology.  \\nThe BMW VISION Neue Klasse represents the entire range of \\ntechnological innovations with which the BMW Group is under-\\nlining its future entrepreneurial viability. It stands for the dawn of \\na new era of individual mobility: electric, digital and circular. \\nDigitalisation stands for innovation and customer focus \\nDigitalisation is a key element in keeping the vehicle constantly \\nup to date for customers long after they have taken delivery of \\ntheir new automobile. Since the launch of Operating System 7 in \\n2018, remote software upgrades1 have been available for BMW \\nvehicles. Apart from these software upgrades, the BMW Group \\nalso releases new functions and features on an ongoing basis. \\nAt the end of 2023, over six million BMW vehicles worldwide \\nwere already fully updatable. In other words, these vehicles can \\nbe updated in every respect, including infotainment, the drive \\nsystem, driver assistance, convenience and safety. The BMW \\nGroup can currently update over 30 derivatives of all its drive var-\\niants remotely over the air. \\nBMW ConnectedDrive upgrades also allow additional functions \\nto be either bought or simply booked for a specific period after \\nthe vehicle has been initially purchased. \\nThe vehicle as a digital experience \\nThe latest generation of BMW Group vehicles offers customers a \\nmaximum of interaction, infotainment and connectivity. State-of-\\nthe-art on- and off-board technologies such as 5G connectivity \\nand cloud services make the latest BMW vehicles an integral part \\nof their users’ digital ecosystems. The comprehensive connectiv-\\nity enables a whole host of digital services and functions, from \\nsmart and learning navigation to in -car gaming and video \\nstreaming. The vehicle is thus becoming the ”next living space” \\nfor its users. \\nWith the further development of the BMW iDrive in 2023 and the \\n”QuickSelect” fast access concept, an improved menu structure \\nbased on devices from the consumer electronics sector is being \\nadded to the system. With the right information in the right place, \\nthe new BMW iDrive provides users with a concentrated, confi-\\ndent driving experience. The latest BMW iDrive generation is \\nbased on the BMW Operating System 8.5 and BMW Operating \\nSystem 9.2 \\nThe latest MINI vehicles in the “New MINI Family” also incorpo-\\nrate these technology modules and, with the MINI Operating \\nSystem 9, offer their customers an unmistakable digital user ex-\\nperience typical for the MINI brand. The iconic, round OLED dis-\\nplay takes centre stage in this concept. \\nSoftware expertise at the BMW Group \\nMore than twenty years ago, with the founding of BMW Car IT \\nthe BMW Group began developing its own soft ware Since then, \\nthe company has continued to expand its teams of developers to \\nform a global network. Beginning with the Ulm site in southern \\nGermany, its software expertise has been bolstered by the joint \\nventures Critical TechWorks in Portugal and BA TechWorks in \\nChina. \\nDigital connectivity and automation \\nAutomated functions and digitally connected vehicles can help \\ncut emissions, reduce the risk of accidents and ease traffic con-\\ngestion. That’s why the BMW Group is consistently driving this \\nissue forward – with a sharp focus on customer convenience and \\nsafety. \\nTo ensure the safety of automated systems, the BMW Group is \\npromoting the development of industry -wide ISO standards for \\npartially, highly and fully automated driving functions. The wor k \\non classifying the standardisation of SAE 3 Level 3 and Level 4 \\nfunctions has resulted in an ISO technical report that is due to be \\npublished as an ISO technical specification in 2024. Further-\\nmore, in 2023 an ISO PAS standard was published that supports \\nthe introduction of Level 2 systems with innovative driver inte-\\ngration. The documents define uniform technical standards for \\nsafe assisted and automated driving. \\n1 The availability and contents of remote software upgrades depends on the country, model, equip-\\nment and software version installed. \\n2 The use of OS 8.5 and OS 9 depends on the vehicle class and the production period. \\n3 SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) levels categorise the degree of automation from manual \\nto autonomous driving in five stages. \\n4 ↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures. \\n4\"),\n",

With the help of virtual simulations and \\nreal-life testing, all driving situations are covered, whether in the \\ncity, in the country, on the highway or when parking. We are thus \\ncreating the basis for meeting our customers’ high safety stand-\\nards when it comes to automated driving. We also operate re-\\nsearch facilities in Munich, where we were involved in the \\n↗ TEMPUS* research project in collaboration with the city authori-\\nties. Between 2021 and 2023, we gathered practical experience \\non a wide range of use cases relating to automated driving func-\\ntions and innovative mobility services in urban areas. The BMW \\nGroup also has research facilities located in China and the USA, \\nenabling it to integrate its two largest markets with regard to \\nroad- and traffic law-related issues right from the outset. \\nThe new BMW 5 Series sets new standards in terms of digital \\nconnectivity and automation. Among other things, the vehicle \\ncan be optionally equipped with a highway assistant, which per-\\nmanently takes over distance control and steering tasks and, for \\nthe first time, actively changes lanes when confirmed by the \\ndriver’s gaze. \\nFollowing recent approval by the Federal Motor Transport Au-\\nthority, the new BMW 7 Series will be equipped with Level 3 func-\\ntions for the first time. The option will be available as of March \\n2024, making the BMW Group one of the leading automobile \\nmanufacturers in the field of highly automated driving. \\nDrivetrain technologies of the future \\nWhen developing drive system technologies, the BMW Group \\nconsiders the needs of its customers worldwide. For this reason \\nwe are constantly developing existing drivetrain technologies in \\nthe interests of efficiency, decarbonisation and resource conser-\\nvation. At the same time, we continue to research new drivetrain \\ntechnologies with the ultimate aim of developing them for series \\nproduction. \\nNew generation of battery cells \\nHigh-performance, innovative and sustainably produced battery \\ncells are the key to success for individual electric mobility. With its \\nNEUE KLASSE models, as of 2025 the BMW Group will be using \\nnewly developed, round battery cells for the first time, which are \\noptimally coordinated to suit the new architecture. The sixth gen-\\neration of our lithium-ion cells represents a giant technological \\nleap forward compared with the previous generation, effectively \\nincreasing energy density by more than 20%, charging speed by \\nup to 30% and range by around 30%. The carbon emissions \\ngenerated by cell production will be reduced by up to 60%. \\nElectrified vehicles as part of the power grid \\nThe BMW Group is conducting its own research and develop-\\nment work with the aim of integrating electrified vehicles in the \\npower grid. The focus is on technologies such as smart charging, \\na key component of the ↗ BMW ChargeForward service, which en-\\nables customers to synchronise their charging behaviour with the \\ncurrent grid load and the use of renewable energy. The technol-\\nogy has been available to all drivers of electrified vehicles in the \\nUSA since November 2023. Another cross-sectoral project \\nknown as ↗ Bidirectional Charging Management (BCM) was successfully \\ncompleted at the end of 2022. Over a period of three years, the \\nBMW Group, together with grid operators and universities, tested \\nhow electric vehicles can become mobile energy storage units \\nand thus part of the power grid system. The results of the project \\nunderline the great potential of bidirectional charging and were \\nincorporated in an initial customer offering, Connected Home \\nCharging, in 2023. The project is a strategic cooperation with the \\ngrid operator E.ON, which aims to establish a Europe-wide eco-\\nsystem for smart charging at home. The innovation enables cus-\\ntomers to connect their electrified BMW or MINI vehicle with their \\nsmart home and the power grid. The service has been available \\nin an initial expansion stage in several European countries since \\nlate 2023. In the coming years, it is to be expanded and ex-\\ntended to include additional scope with the ultimate aim of ena-\\nbling bidirectional charging as well. \\n[[ BMW Highway Assistant and Active Lane Change \\nIn the new BMW 5 Series Sedan, customers can use the BMW Highway \\nAssistant and Active Lane Change feature for the first time. The BMW \\nHighway Assistant enables drivers to take their hands off the steering \\nwheel and place them in a comfortable position when driving for pro-\\nlonged distances. The function is also supplemented by a new feature: \\nthe Active Lane Change assistant with driver’s gaze confirmation, \\nwhich enables the vehicle to change lanes automatically without the \\ndriver having to touch the steering wheel. All the driver needs to do is \\nglance at the wing m irrors to confirm the lane change. The prerequi-\\nsites for this technology include high -precision sensors, a powerful \\ncomputing platform and connection to the BMW Cloud. \\nTake your hands off the steering wheel and temporarily turn your at-\\ntention away from the traffic situation – this is highly automated driving \\nat Level 3 and can be experienced in new BMW 7 Series models as of \\nMarch 2024. BMW Personal Pilot L3 is the name of the new function \\nthat relieves customers of the task of driving in defined traffic situa-\\ntions and regulates speed, distance and lane guidance for them. The \\ninnovative system enables drivers to engage in secondary activities \\n(such as writing messages or watching video streaming) on highways \\nwith structurally separated lanes and at speeds of up to 60 km/h. ]] \\n'),\n",

Our holistic activities \\ncomprise the following three pillars and underline the \\nBMW Group’s commitment to innovation: \\n― Corporate: The virtualisation of internal processes, methods \\nand products with real-time collaboration, regardless of \\nlocation \\nFor example, as part of the iFactory, planners can use vir-\\ntual reality to virtually assess buildings, systems, logistics \\nand the assembly of new production areas and test pro-\\ncesses in 3D, long before construction is scheduled to \\nbegin.\\n― Commercial: Interaction with both new and existing tech -\\ns\\navvy target groups in virtual spaces and virtual worlds. \\nEngagement on digital platforms enables experience -\\noriented interaction with young target groups (Gen Z) within \\ntheir digital ecosystems with the aim of enhancing brand \\nimage and developing long- term customer loyalty. In \\ndedicated virtual worlds such as the BMW Motorrad \\nMetaRide, innovative products can be experienced in a new \\nway and supported throughout the entire customer journey. \\n― In-car experiences: Enhancing the quality of experience with \\na focus on infotainment, productivity and gaming. \\nWith the M Mixed Reality approach, for example, a team of \\nengineers at BMW M GmbH has developed an immersive \\ndriving experience for the BMW M2 and M4, which is now \\nbeing made available to Driving Experience customers for \\nthe first time. Wearing VR goggles, drivers can be immersed \\nin a virtual world while driving the real vehicle. In addition, \\nthe BMW Group has made further inroads into the gaming \\nscene with the launch of Air Console, i.e. casual gaming in \\nnumerous current BMW and MINI models. \\nArtificial intelligence \\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly \\ndeveloped and performs ever more comprehensive tasks. GPTs \\n(Generative Pretrained Transformers) support and accelerate \\noperational processes, including creative tasks. The technology \\nholds considerable potential for the way we work, collaborate, \\ndevelop, share knowledge and interact with our customers and \\nhow the future experience within our vehicles will be designed. \\nThe development of generative AI is still in its infancy and indus-\\ntrialisation has only just begun. We are already using the first \\ntools based on this technology or investigating its potential for \\nspecific applications, such as: \\n― Image-generating AI for end -to-end support of our design \\nand vehicle construction processes \\n― Large language models, such as those on which ChatGPT \\nis based, for voice applications within the vehicle \\n― Text and image generation applications, as well as \\nknowledge management based on large language models \\nfor exploration for all employees \\n― Application of generative AI in various processes at the \\nBMW Group, such as: \\n― Market and sales communication, e.g. generated \\nmarketing texts \\n― Knowledge management for customer interaction in call \\ncentres \\n― Knowledge management or comparison of offers in \\npurchasing \\n― Testing and comparison of vehicle specifications \\n― Coding support for IT and vehicle development  \\nShaping the future of mobility \\nTh\\ne BMW Group is involved in numerous research and imple-\\nmentation projects for developing new mobility concepts. The \\nmain focus is on ↗ pilot projects that improve the quality of life and \\npromote more sustainable urban mobility. In Munich, we are co-\\ninitiators of the new ↗ Mobile Future Alliance Munich . Together with \\npolicymakers, the Technical University of Munich and the Munich \\nTransport and Tariff Association, a strategy for sustainable mo-\\nbility in the greater Munich area is to be developed. Specifically, \\nit is about using street space more efficiently, creating open \\nspaces for liveable urban areas, establishing new mobility solu-\\ntions and promoting parking space management, among other \\nthings. \\nIn Rotterdam, we are working with the city authorities, Erasmus \\nUniversity and other local partners on various pilot projects, in-\\ncluding the improved interconnectedness of different modes of \\ntransport (intermodality), visionary urban vehicle concepts and \\nthe more efficient use of charging infrastructure. The BMW Group \\nalso held a ↗ stakeholder dialogue together with the City of Rotter-\\ndam in the reporting year.

The \\nglobal network of BMW Group Technology Offices is also making \\nan essential contribution to maintaining the Group’s leading role \\nin terms of innovation. \\nThese offices are strategically positioned worldwide and focus \\non key hotspots of technology and innovation. The potential of \\nnew technologies is therefore being explored in pilot projects and \\ntransferred to the Group’s centralised teams. Whether manufac-\\nturing, developing smart city solutions or the mobility of the fu-\\nture, these Technology Offices are driving forward innovations \\nthat benefit the Group in all its lines of business. \\nGlobal dialogue with start -ups is an important means for the \\nBMW Group to gain impetus. This is based on three pillars, com-\\nprising ↗ BMW i Ventures  (through which we invest in technology \\nstart-ups), the start-up ↗ Platform URBAN-X (a MINI brand-initiated \\nstart-up that focuses primarily on urban living) and the ↗ BMW \\nStartup Garage. The latter serves as the BMW Group’s venture cli-\\nent unit and is tasked with searching for innovations that repre-\\nsent a significant benefit for products, services, systems and pro-\\ncesses. The aim of the programme is to evaluate and empower \\nstart-ups to become suppliers and partners. \\nThe trend research conducted by the technology offices enables \\nthe BMW Group to anticipate the technological developments of \\ntomorrow. The results are made publicly available in the ↗ Trend \\nRadar where sci entific institutions, start -ups, but also potential \\npartners can make use of them. \\nWhen it opened in Silicon Valley in 1998, the BMW Group Tech-\\nnology Office USA was the Group’s first research and develop-\\nment facility to be established outside of Munich. Originally \\nbased in Palo Alto, the BMW tech office moved to its current lo-\\ncation in Mountain View in 2011. Today, the Mountain View \\nteam is part of a global network of BMW tech offices strategically \\nlocated in key technology hotspots around the world. They all \\nplay a crucial role in the BMW Group’s open approach to innova-\\ntion. Apart from the locations in Silicon Valley and Munich, the \\nworldwide network also includes Seoul, Shanghai, Tel Aviv and \\nTokyo. \\nWorldwide cooperations and partnerships \\nTo ensure its long-term success, the BMW Group enters into tar-\\ngeted cooperations and partnerships with companies from vari-\\nous industries Several of the Group’s largest collaborations and \\ninvestments are listed below: \\nSince 2022, the BMW Group and Qualcomm Technologies have \\nbeen working together to develop solutions for the next genera-\\ntion of automated driving. The three companies aim to develop \\ntechnologies ranging from New Car Assessment Program \\n(NCAP) solutions and advanced Level 2 driving assistance sys-\\ntems to the Level 3 functionalities of highly automated driving. \\nThe joint development of software functions is based on BMW’s \\ncurrent software toolkit for automated driving. Within the terms \\nof the cooperation, ultimately some 1,300 specialists will work \\ntogether at various locations worldwide, including sites in Ger-\\nmany, the USA, Sweden, China, Romania and the BMW Test \\nCentre in Sokolov in the Czech Republic. \\nThe HERE mapping service was acquired by BMW, Mercedes -\\nBenz and Audi in 2015. Continental, Intel, Mitsubishi, Nippon \\nTelegraph and Telephone, and Pioneer are also current share-\\nholders. The participation in HERE ensures long-term access to \\nscalable, high-resolution maps. The development of a central-\\nised, more efficient geo-database, from which all HERE products \\n(including the currently used SD navigation map and HD maps) \\ncan be fed and continuously updated, was completed in 2023. \\nIn collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the \\nBMW Group is developing innovative cloud technologies for pro-\\ncessing vehicle data. The two companies are also working to-\\ngether to develop commercial standard cloud solutions for the \\nsecure handling of vehicle data. The agreement is a continuation \\nof the partnership in the field of vehicle data that began back in \\n2015. As in all previous collaborations with AWS, the \\nBMW Group retains full and exclusive control over the data and \\ncomplies with the data protection regulations applicable in its re-\\nspective markets. \\nSince the launch of the first BMW voice assistant (BMW Intelli-\\ngent Personal Assistant) in 2018, voice interaction has become \\nan increasingly important part of the BMW iDrive display and op-\\nerating concept. The next generation of the voice assistant will \\nbe based on Amazon’s Alexa technology, thus enabling an even \\nmore natural dialogue between driver and vehicle.  \\nThe BMW Group is continuously building on its various coopera-\\ntion arrangements aimed at expanding charging infrastructure in \\ngeneral. In addition to the BMW Group, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, \\nPorsche, Volkswagen, Audi, Hyundai/Kia and BlackRock are all \\ninvolved in the long-established IONITY joint venture. The aim is \\nto set up an efficient, high -power charging network for electric \\nvehicles right across Europe. \\nOn 19 October 2023, the BMW  Group jointly founded a com-\\npany together with General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mer-\\ncedes-Benz and Stellantis. The partners are working together \\nwith the aim of establishing a public charging network in the USA \\nand Canada. \\nOn 6 November 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement \\nwith Mercedes-Benz to establish a company based in China with \\nthe objective of building charging infrastructure in that market. \\nThe approval by the antitrust authorities has already been given. \\nThe BMW Group holds a 50% stake in the recently founded \\ncompany. ↗ Reliable and comprehensive charging opportunities '),\n",

The range of \\nservices provides customers with access to various modes of \\ntransport other than their own vehicle. \\nAs Europe’s largest multimodal mobility platform, FREE NOW \\ncombines the entire range of various forms of mobility in one app. \\nApart from taxi cabs and private ride services, various types of e-\\nscooters as well as car -sharing vehicles can also be booked via  \\nthe FREE NOW app. By 2025, the share of electrically powered \\ntrips is projected to increase to 50% and users are set to travel \\nfully electrically as of 2030.  \\nThe BMW Group offers a range of additional mobility services in \\nthe MyBMW app. It provides customers with access to exclusive \\nFREE NOW services and, in cooperation with SIXT, to rental cars \\nwith exclusive specialised services. This BMW add-on mobility \\noffering is currently available to BMW and MINI customers in a \\ngrowing number of markets. For business customers and fleet \\noperators, among other services the BMW Group offers keyless \\nvehicle use for flexible fleet concepts or digital and efficient vehi-\\ncle management options. The BMW Group’s range of services \\nalso includes comprehensive charging solutions for the home, \\nthe workplace and on the road. ↗ Reliable and comprehensive charging \\nopportunities \\nPRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY \\nAll BMW Group products and services are required to meet the \\nhighest standards in terms of quality and safety, People’s safety \\nhas top priority, right from the product development stage. With \\nthis point in mind, optimum chassis tuning, highly effective brak-\\ning systems and stable passenger compartments are key fac-\\ntors. Moreover, BMW Group vehicles are equipped with state-of-\\nthe-art safety systems that reduce the risk of accidents and inju-\\nries (active safety systems such as collision warning or lane de-\\nparture warning systems) as well as mitigate the consequences \\nin the event of an accident (passive safety systems such as air-\\nbags or seat belts). \\nWe are also working continuously to further improve the safety of \\nour vehicles. In 2023, the new BMW 5 Series achieved top marks \\nin the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP). \\nThe new BMW i5 * was also named ”Safest car of the year” by \\nthe Korean New Car Assessment Programme (KNCAP). Further \\nawards gained in 2023 included the “Top Safety Pick+” from the \\nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS, USA) for the new \\nBMW 5 Series, the BMW X3 and the BMW X1, as well as a triple \\n“Good” rating in the China Insurance Automotive Safety Index (C-\\nIASI) for the BMW X1. ↗ GRI Index: 416-1 ↗ SASB Index \\nQuality management \\nIn addition to its high quality and compliance with statutory reg-\\nulations and standards, the BMW Group’s comprehensive quality \\nmanagement system also focuses on ensuring the safety of its \\nproducts. From the development stage to manufacturing, they \\nare therefore subject to rigorous testing procedures. Further-\\nmore, any information received from customers regarding poten-\\ntial deviations from quality standards are systematically followed \\nup. \\nIf a safety risk or a compliance-related defect is found, the BMW \\nGroup implements all the measures required to remedy the issue \\nfollowing detailed discussions with the relevant authorities. In \\n2023, safety- and compliance-related technical campaigns af-\\nfected around 1.8 million vehicles (2022: 3.4 million vehicles). All \\nthese actions were voluntary and carried out in coordination with \\nthe authorities concerned. The BMW  Group works according to \\nthe principle of prevention. To avoid technical campaigns of this \\ntype going forward, the BMW Group has also developed a com-\\nprehensive programme that has been in place since 2023. \\nPollutants management \\nTo the extent possible, the BMW Group excludes the use of prob-\\nlematic substances right from the vehicle design stage and sets \\nout corresponding stipulations for its suppliers. Guidance is pro-\\nvided in the form of the ↗ Global Automotive Declarable Substance List \\n(GADSL). At the same time, we are working to reduce pollutant \\nemissions in the interior of our vehicles to an absolute minimum. \\nAll BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are equipped as \\nstandard with interior air filters that prevent exterior pollutants \\nand particles such as dust or pollen from entering the vehicle. \\nSince 2020, the BMW Group has been using air filters equipped \\nwith nanofibre technology that are specially designed to prevent \\ncertain microbial particles and allergens as well as ultra-fine par-\\nticulate matter from entering the vehicle. \\n* ↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.

The \\ninformation is supplemented by detailed notes and background \\ninformation on the services, accessories and components per-\\ntaining to each individual vehicle. \\nWith the ↗ BMW M Driving Experience , the BMW Group offers driver \\nand rider safety training for BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad \\nbrand vehicles in 25 countries. Participants learn how to handle \\ntheir vehicles in a safe manner and are sensitised to recognise \\ndangerous situations in road traffic. In 2023, more than 110,000 \\ncustomers worldwide took part in these training courses. \\nCustomer data protection \\nRight from the early stages of developing its functions and ser-\\nvices, the BMW Group sets out strict requirements for data pro-\\ntection due to the growing IT risks. Any personal data required in \\nthe course of contact with our customers are only collected, pro-\\ncessed or used to the extent legally permitted and with the active \\nconsent of the data subject. \\nIn order to ensure the protection of custome r data, despite the \\nchallenge posed by the growing number of digitalised services, \\nwe are constantly developing our data management systems \\nand respond promptly to any information received regarding \\ndata protection risks. If customers have any queries regarding \\nthe processing of their personal data, they can contact the Cus-\\ntomer Interaction Centre or the Data Protection Officer in their re-\\nspective market. With the aim of maintaining our high level of \\ndata protection, we regularly check all applications that process \\ncustomer data to ensure full implementation of all current and \\nappropriate IT security measures. Teams of experts also search \\nspecifically for any vulnerabilities in existing applications. We also \\ntranslate any new findings into binding, Group-wide standards. \\nThe BMW Group collaborates closely with the relevant data pro-\\ntection supervisory authorities – particularly regarding funda-\\nmental data protection issues such as those arising from the in-\\ncreasing connectivity of vehicles. ↗ GRI Index: 3-3, 418-1 \\nSecure connectivity \\nThe BMW Group’s responsibility for its products includes the se-\\ncure transmission of vehicle data to third parties. For example, \\nGroup vehicles are not directly connected to the Internet, but \\ncommunicate directly and exclusively with the BMW Connect-\\nedDrive back-end facilities via a secure connection within a vir-\\ntual private network. The strategy enables the BMW  Group to \\nminimise the risk of unauthorised third parties accessing either \\nthe vehicle itself or any of its sensitive data. The access point to \\nthe Internet is controlled via a gateway. We currently see this ex-\\ntended vehicle approach in accordance with ISO 20078 as the \\nbest solution for offering an outstanding level of data security and \\ndata protection and meeting the statutory cybersecurity require-\\nments (e.g. UN R155). \\n↗ CarData provides BMW and MINI customers with transparency \\nand sovereignty over the transfer of data to authorised third par-\\nties. With the introduction of the service in Germany and Europe \\nin 2017 and the USA in 2020, the BMW Group is fully imple-\\nmenting the current requirements of the EU General Data Pro-\\ntection Regulation (EU GDPR) and the California Consumer Pri-\\nvacy Act (CCPA). The BMW Group deploys state-of-the-art tech-\\nnologies to prevent vehicle theft.

We are taking ambitious \\nsteps to contribute to progressive decarbonisation, and have \\ntherefore developed a carbon reduction strategy based on a ho-\\nlistic approach. \\nFor the BMW Group, holistic means decarbonising the emissions \\ngenerated by its vehicles over their entire life cycle. Although the \\ngradual electrification of the Group’s fleet is contributing towards \\ndecarbonisation during the use phase, emissions are also in-\\ncreasing at the same time, particularly in t he supply chain. The \\nmain reason for this is the carbon -intensive production of com-\\nponents such as high-voltage batteries. Reducing carbon emis-\\nsions within the supply chain is therefore one of our main selec-\\ntion criteria when awarding contracts to suppliers. With this strat-\\negy, the BMW Group is making a vital contribution to decarbon-\\nising the entire life cycle of its products, including energy-inten-\\nsive raw materials such as steel, light metals and plastics. The \\napproach also helps reduce carbon emissions across various \\nsectors. ↗ Carbon emissions in the supply chain \\nThe BMW Group’s decarbonisation  targets are part of its inte-\\ngrated corporate target system and validated by the Science \\nBased Targets initiative (SBTi). They are being implemented \\nunder the responsibility of the Board of Management in the BMW \\nGroup’s various departments and thus throughout the organisa-\\ntion ↗ Performance Indicators and Performance Management. Specific de-\\ncarbonisation targets are derived from the overarching objectives \\nfor each vehicle project, with the aim of achieving substantial im-\\nprovements from one vehicle generation to the next. The respon-\\nsibility for achieving these goals lies with specialist units in the \\nmanagement areas of Development, Purchasing, Supplier Net-\\nwork, Production and Logistics. Internal control and reporting \\nsystems take into account the various stages in the value chain, \\ncomprising the supply chain, development, production and the \\nuse phase. Among other factors, our decarbonisation measures \\nare based on emissions specifications at material and compo-\\nnent level. Target management and the monitoring of target \\nachievement are performed at vehicle level and subsequently \\naggregated for reporting at Group level. \\nWe explain how the BMW Group manages the topic of sustaina-\\nbility across the organisation in the chapter ↗ The BMW Group \\nStrategy. We also report on t he management of climate -related \\nopportunities and risks in the chapters ↗ Outlook and ↗ Risks and \\nOpportunities. \\nReducing carbon emissions across the entire value chain \\nThe BMW  Group aims to achieve ↗ Net zero  carbon emissions \\nacross the entire value chain1 by no later than 2050. This objec-\\ntive is based on decarbonisation targets up to 2030 that were \\nvalidated in 2021 by the SBTi and are in line with the climate \\ntargets set out in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming. \\nBased on this commitment, we are part of the SBTi and the in-\\nternational ↗ Race to Zero Campaign led by the United Nations. \\nWe have set ourselves the following decarbonisation targets 2 to \\nbe achieved by 2030 (base year 2019 for each scope): \\n― Decarbonisation by an average of 80% per vehicl e \\nproduced at our own plants and sites (Scope 1 and 2) 3. \\nThese targets can be achieved, for example, by reducing our \\nenergy requirements and simultaneously increasing the use \\nof renewable energy.4 ↗ Carbon emissions of BMW Group locations \\n― Decarbonisation in the use phase 5 of the vehicle (Scope 3 \\ndownstream6) by an average of more than 50% per \\nkilometre driven.

In China, aver-\\nage fleet carbon emissions were 146.4 g CO 2/km\\u200a9 in accord-\\nance with the WLTC test cycle (2022: 150.6 g CO 2/km WLTC). \\nThus, we also met the regulatory CAFC fleet -wide consumption \\nrequirements applicable during the year under report.10 \\nThe BMW Group’s global fleet -wide carbon emissions 11 aver-\\naged 185.4 g CO2/km12 (2022: 193.7 g CO2/km) in the year un-\\nder report. These figures correspond to a decrease of 15.1% \\ncompared to the base year 2019 (2019: 218.5 g CO2/km). As in \\nprevious years, when calculating the emissions figure, the \\nBMW Group takes into account average fleet-wide carbon emis-\\nsions (including upstream emissions for fuel and electric charg-\\ning) in the EU, the USA and China and standardises them in ac-\\ncordance with the WLTP. With a share of more than 80% of \\nBMW Group deliveries, these three core markets and regions \\nform a reliable basis for calculating global carbon fleet emissions. \\nThe BMW Group pays close attention to carbon emissions legis-\\nlation in its various markets. Current developments in the year \\nunder report included the adoption of fleet -wide carbon emis-\\nsions limits in the EU for the years 2030 and 2035 and the pub-\\nlication of draft legislation for GHG fleet-wide consumption tar-\\ngets in the USA for the period from 2027 to 2032. The statutory \\nframework for China’s Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate \\nwas amended in the year under review. The amendment covers \\nthe years 2024 to 2025 and increased the quota set for the \\nnumber of zero emissions vehicles. The BMW Group supports \\nthe development of harmonised regulations – both nationally \\nand internationally.

We \\nprovide information on the BMW Group’s most important climate \\npolicy positions and activities in our ↗ Climate Commitment Report. \\nMaking conventional drivetrains more efficient and lowering \\ntheir emissions \\nVehicles powered by modern, efficient internal combustion en-\\ngines continue to play a major role for our customers. This fact is \\nparticularly true in regions where unrestricted access to charging \\ninfrastructure is not yet available nationwide. For this reason, the \\nBMW Group will continue to work on improving the already hi gh \\nefficiency of its conventional drivetrains going forward through \\nthe use of innovative technologies as part of the Efficient Dynam-\\nics technology package. A key component in this respect is the \\nbroader use of 48-volt technology. 48-volt recuperation systems \\nuse the energy recovered when braking to supply the vehicle’s \\nelectrical system and generate additional propulsion, thereby re-\\nducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. In Europe, in ad-\\ndition to our all-electric models and plug-in hybrids, we offer nu-\\nmerous new model series that feature a 48 -volt recuperation \\nsystem. Since 2022, our modular engines have been fitted with \\nthe second, even more efficient generation of 48-volt technology. \\nThe further development of energy management in BMW Group \\nvehicles, alongside other measures such as switching to highly \\nefficient tyres, is designed to ensure additional efficiency and op-\\ntimised consumption figures. \\n1 EU-27 countries including Norway and Iceland. \\n2 Including an allowance for eco-innovations (with minor significance). \\n3 Average carbon emissions fleet-wide within the EU (including Norway and Iceland) are required \\nto be reported in accordance with the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure \\n(WLTP) type test cycle as of 2021. Since 2021, this metric has been used by the EU Commission \\nas the basis for calculating carbon fleet emissions.  \\n4 This is a preliminary internal calculation with a potential variation of +/- 0.5 g CO2/km, as official \\nregistration figures from the authorities are not available for all EU states. Figures officially pub-\\nlished by the EU Commission are not expected to be available until November of the following \\nyear.

Failure to remain below the regulatory limits results in negative credits. At \\nthe end of a model year, a positive GHG credit balance must be achieved in order to meet regula-\\ntory requirements. As GHG credits are valid for five years on the US market, a short-term failure to \\nmeet fleet-wide limit targets in one year can be compensated by undercutting them in a previous \\nyear. Moreover, it is possible to purchase credits from other manufacturers. In 2023, the BMW \\nGroup drew on existing credits from previous years. However, it did not purchase any external \\ncredits from other manufacturers.

In 2023, the BMW Group \\ndrew on existing credits from previous years. However, it did not purchase any external credits \\nfrom other manufacturers. The requirements were therefore met without exception by using self-\\ngenerated and existing credits. A settlement between CAFC and ZEV remains in place. \\n11 For a definition, see ↗ Glossary. \\n12 Takes into account an additional 10 % in line with SBTi to cover possible differences between \\nWLTP figures and real driving emissions.

The same applies to non -EU \\ncountries as for example Switzerland, Norway , the UK and Ice-\\nland, where comparable regulations apply.1 At the same time, the \\nBMW Group is already preparing for the introduction of the up-\\ncoming Euro 7 emissions standard, which is currently undergo-\\ning the legislative process and will include for the first time limits \\nfor brake particle emissions and tyre abrasion amongst other \\nthings. \\nThe level of nitrogen oxides is a crucial factor for air quality in \\ncities. For this reason, since mid-2018 the BMW Group has been \\nusing a highly effective combination of nitrogen oxide storage \\ncatalytic converters (NSCs) and selective catalytic reduction \\n(SCR) systems that include urea injection (AdBlue) in all BMW \\nvehicles as well as in the larger diesel-powered MINI models. \\nThe efficiency of exhaust gas aftertreatment has been further in-\\ncreased by the use of an improved oxidation catalyst in combi-\\nnation with a two -stage SCR system. The new technology has \\nbeen available since 2020 with the revised generation of six-cyl-\\ninder diesel engines and is currently being rolled out to other \\nmodels. There have already been signs of a reduction in NOx \\npollution in German cities over the last few years. Apart from var-\\nious measures taken to reduce pollutants, the ongoing renewal \\nof the vehicle fleets of all automobile manufacturers has also \\ncontributed to the improvement. ↗ GRI Index: 305-7 \\nELECTROMOBILITY \\nThe BMW Group sees the electrification of its model range as a \\nkey component of its product strategy to reduce fleet emissions \\nand thus achieve its ambitious strategic ↗ decarbonisation targets. \\nWe already provide our customers with an extensive range of all-\\nelectric, battery-powered vehicles (BEV). In 2023, another high-\\nvolume model, the all-electric BMW i52 business sedan, went on \\nsale. MINI presented the new all-electric MINI Cooper SE2 to the \\npublic during the year under report. The Rolls -Royce brand \\nlaunched its first all- electric model, the Rolls -Royce Spectre2, in \\n2023. The BMW  Group therefore has at least one all -electric \\nmodel in its range for all three premium brands and in all seg-\\nments. At the end of the reporting period, a total of 20 all-electric \\nmodels in ten different series were available to order from the \\nBMW Group. \\nDemand for all-electric vehicles rising \\nWith our growing range of all-electric models, we are serving a \\nrapidly increasing level of demand. Deliveries of all-electric cars \\nincreased significantly again year on year to 375,716 units \\n(2022: 215,752 units/+74.1%). The share of all-electric vehi-\\ncles to total deliveries was 14.7%, also significantly higher than \\nin the previous year (2022: 9.0%/+63.3%). Since the 2023 fi-\\nnancial year, this key figure has replaced the proportion of elec-\\ntrified vehicles, including PHEV vehicles, which was reported as \\na key performance indicator up to 2022. \\nAs of 2025, the Group will take its core BMW brand into a new, \\nconsistently all-electric era with the NEUE KLASSE. By the early \\n2030s, the MINI and Rolls-Royce brands will have an exclusively \\nall-electric product portfolio. The strategy will help to achieve a \\nshare of more than 50% of the BMW Group’s global sales with \\nall-electric vehicles – depending on certain framework conditions \\nsuch as the development of a comprehensive charging infra-\\nstructure by 2030. The BMW Group aims to have delivered more \\nthan 10 million all-electric vehicles to customers by 2030. \\n1 The other non-EU countries to which this statement applies are Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and \\nHerzegovina, Liechtenstein, Macau, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey. \\n2 ↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures. \\n2'),\n",

In addition to all -electric vehicles, our customers \\ncan therefore choose from a wide range of plug -in hybrids and \\nvehicles powered by efficient combustion engines. Our ↗ flexible \\nproduction systems and scalable modular vehicle system reflect our \\nrigorous focus on customer needs. With the  launch of the new \\nBMW i51, a further model series is now available with all three \\ntypes of drive system, which previously applied to the BMW X1, \\nBMW X3, BMW 3 Series and the BMW 7 Series. \\nAt the BMW Group, customer -oriented technological diversity \\nalso includes the ongoing development of fuel cell technology. \\nDepending on the segment, we see hydrogen-powered electric \\nvehicles as a potentially key alternative to battery-powered elec-\\ntric mobility and thus as an opportunity to reduce carbon emis-\\nsions even more quickly. ↗ Hydrogen-powered pilot fleet  operating \\nsuccessfully \\nDesigning electric vehicle ranges to match user behaviour \\nThe BMW Group assesses the increase in the electric ranges of \\nits vehicles from various points of view. Our main approach is to \\noptimally adapt vehicle ranges to the respective purpose of use \\nand user behaviour. With this strategy we also take into account \\nthe environmental impact, as greater range also means deploy-\\ning larger and therefore heavier high-voltage batteries. This re-\\nlationship has an effect on resource consumption and the carbon \\nfootprint of the supply chain as well as the vehicle’s weight and \\ntherefore its electricity consumption. \\nThe new all-electric MINI Cooper SE 1, which is mainly designed \\nfor urban use, has a customer-focused range of around 400 kil-\\nometres (WLTP2). The new BMW i5 1 can achieve a range of up \\nto 582 km in the statutory WLTP test cycle, depending on factors \\nsuch as equipment and type of motor. With offers such as the \\nBMW eDrive Zone, attractive electricity tariffs for driving, charg-\\ning equipment, the integration of charging in the vehicle app and \\nincreased ranges, we are helping drivers of plug-in hybrids to \\ndrive electrically as frequently and over as long a distance as \\npossible. For instance, the BMW X5 Plug-in-Hybrid1 from the \\ncompact segment can cover up to 110 kilometres (WLTP2) solely \\non battery power. \\nThinking holistically about electric mobility \\nThe BMW Group’s electrified vehicles are characterised  by their \\nhigh efficiency and low consumption. However, the BMW  Group \\nhas greater aspirations:  its vehicles need to be as eco- friendly \\nas possible, not only during their locally carbon -free use phase, \\nbut also in terms of their overall footprint, including the supply \\nchain and production. ↗ Carbon Emissions Unlike conventional com-\\nbustion engine -powered vehicles, the environmental impact of \\nbattery-powered automobiles lies predominantly in the up-\\nstream value chain. Where the use of natural raw materials to \\nmanufacture battery cells and the carbon-intensive production of \\nbatteries make a significant impact. \\nIt is therefore particularly important to the BMW Group to include \\nenvironmental and social aspects in the production of compo-\\nnents such as electric motors, high-voltage storage systems and \\nbattery cells. ↗ Carbon emissions in the supply chain, ↗ Social and ecological \\nresponsibility. Other approaches to mitigating the environmental \\nimpacts include increasing the use of recycling and reusing high-\\nvoltage storage units from our BEV and PHEV models in an ap-\\npropriate manner. The BMW Group offers customers who pur-\\nchase its battery-powered vehicles the option to take back their \\nhigh-voltage batteries free of charge. The offer also applies to \\nmarkets where take-back is not mandatory by law. \\nReliable, comprehensive charging opportunities \\nAn expanded, customer-friendly charging infrastructure will pave \\nthe way for the rapid and widespread use of electric mobility. With \\nthe adoption of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation \\n(AFIR) in 2023, the EU resolved to set up a basic network of both \\nelectric charging stations and hydrogen filling stations by the end \\nof 2030. From the BMW Group’s point of view, this is a first key \\nstep towards providing a customer-friendly charging infrastruc-\\nture. The BMW Group remains committed to achieving standard-\\nised framework conditions and encourages offers that enable \\ncustomer-friendly charging on a broad basis.\\u200a An expanded, cus-\\ntomer-friendly charging infrastructure will pave the wa y for the \\nrapid and widespread use of electric mobility. \\nWith BMW and MINI Charging, we offer attractive electricity tariffs \\nand convenient charging solutions – whether on the road, at \\nhome or at work.

The BMW Group is also continu-\\nally enhancing its local supply chains in line with the “local for \\nlocal” principle. At all levels of in -house production, we remain \\ncommitted to consistently conserving resources, continuously \\nimproving energy efficiency and further reducing carbon emis-\\nsions. \\nClosing material loops  \\nThe BMW Group pursues the strategic aim of  reducing the pro-\\nportion of primary materials in its value chain. An important start-\\ning point in this endeavour is to close cycles for certain materials \\nand components. With this objective in mind, the BMW Group re-\\nturns selected production residues to the supplier, enabling \\nthose materials to be recovered and reused in a new production \\nprocess. At the BMW Group, the circular economy principle (“De-\\nsign for Circularity”) is already being implemented as an opera-\\ntional concept in the design of the NEUE KLASSE by the corpo-\\nrate function “Total Vehicle Development” and systematically \\napplied in the development of new vehicle models. \\nThe BMW Group already uses a certain extent, depending on the \\nvehicle, of recycled and reused materials to manufacture its ve-\\nhicles. In line with the “Secondary First” approach, we aim to in-\\ncrease the use of secondary materials going forward, taking both \\ntechnical feasibility and market availability into account. Within \\nthe framework of selected product, material and supplier require-\\nments, we have therefore decided to give preference to second-\\nary materials in our future vehicles. All secondary and primary \\nmaterials used bythe BMW  Group must meet the same high \\nstandards of quality, safety and reliability. \\n↗ GRI Index: 3-3 ↗ Average \\ndistribution of materials in BMW Group vehicles \\nThe BMW i Vision Circular vehicle is emblematic of our ambitions \\nand made entirely from recycled or renewable raw materials. The \\nNEUE KLASSE is also consistent with this vision in that the com-\\nponents cobalt, lithium and nickel used to produce battery cells \\nwill in future contain a certain percentage of secondary materials, \\nthus reducing the volume of primary materials needed and miti-\\ngating the associated negative environmental impacts. The \\nNEUE KLASSE will also contain a higher proportion of secondary \\nmaterials in other material groups such as steel and aluminium. \\nAt the same time, we promote the recovery of end -of-life vehi-\\ncles, components and materials in order to retain them in various \\nmaterial cycles as a source of secondary raw material. Together \\nwith its national sales companies and importers, the BMW Group \\nhas already organised the return of end -of-life vehicles in 32 \\ncountries and offers environmentally friendly recycling at more \\nthan 2,800 points of return. \\n↗ GRI Index: 301-1, 301-3, ↗ SASB Index \\nCompared to primary raw materials, the use of secondary mate-\\nrials also helps reduce carbon emissions – by up to 80% for al-\\numinium and up to 70% for steel to name two examples.\\u200a At the \\nsame time, potential risks associated with the extraction of pri-\\nmary materials, such as high levels of energy consumption and \\ntherefore carbon emissions, long transportation routes, environ-\\nmental damage and risks arising due to a lack of social standards \\nare being mitigated. As a result, the increased use of secondary \\nmaterials also promotes resilience throughout the value chain. \\n↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network \\nInvestments in resource-friendly technologies  \\nVia the ↗ BMW i Ventures venture capital fund, the BMW  Group in-\\nvests in fast-growing technology start-ups. One focus of the in-\\nvestment activity is on businesses that can make a strong con-\\ntribution to achieving carbon neutrality and conserving re-\\nsources. One example is the Swiss company Bcomp, which the \\nBMW Group has held a share in since 2022. Bcomp uses flax to \\ncreate structural components made from natural fibre compo-\\nsites as an alternative to plastic composites. By increasing our \\nstake in the US start-up Boston Metal in April 2023, we are scal-\\ning up our investment in innovative processes for the manufac-\\nture of carbon-reduced steel. In April 2023, BMW i Ventures also \\nacquired a stake in Cyclic Materials, a company developing a re-\\ncycling technology that extracts rare earths and base metals \\nfrom end-of-life products. \\nThe BMW Group is also investing in research and innovation pro-\\njects such as Circular Republic to implement closed material  \\ncycles for certain product groups. The joint initiative of the organ-\\nisation “UnternehmerTUM” and the BMW Group focuses on the \\ntransfer of knowledge between the world of science and compa-\\nnies to promote the circular economy. \\n  \\n[[ From scrap to raw material: the Car2Car funding \\nproject  \\nThe Car2Car project focuses on the recycling of aluminium, steel, glass, \\ncopper and plastic. Together with representatives of the recycling in-\\ndustry, raw materials processors and the scientific community, the \\nBMW Group is leading a project to improve the quality of secondary \\nraw materials obtained from the recycling of end-of-life vehicles. Inno-\\nvative dismantling and automated sorting processes will enable reus-\\nable materials to be extracted to a far greater extent than previously. \\nAs part of the funding pro ject, the BMW Group is providing 433 end -\\nof-life vehicles. In order to cover a representative range, various mod-\\nels out of the Company’s own inventories are being used – from MINI \\nto Rolls-Royce – with combustion engines, plug-in hybrid systems and \\nall-electric drives. ]] '),\n",

Alongside ↗ Carbon Emissions , the other key indicators for \\nmanaging resource efficiency and controlling resource consump-\\ntion within the BMW Group are ↗ energy consumption, ↗ potable water \\nconsumption, the amount of ↗ waste generated and the use of ↗ VOC \\nsolvents. The BMW Group intends to reduce its energy and pota-\\nble water consumption, waste for disposal, and the amount of \\nsolvents used per vehicle produced by 25% in each category by \\n2030 (base year: 2016). \\nA steering committee manages the international environmental \\nprotection network within the BMW Group. Each individual facil-\\nity, area and building is assigned to an internal operator, who, \\nwithin their area, is responsible for the technical systems, the \\nsmooth running of processes and workflows and their environ-\\nmental impacts.1 \\nA certified environmental management system in accordance \\nwith ISO 14001 has been implemented at all BMW  Group pro-\\nduction sites. Moreover, all the Group’s German plants are certi-\\nfied under the EMAS environmental management system. The \\nBMW Group coordinates its worldwide environmental protection \\nmeasures relating to imissions, water, waste, qualification stand-\\nards, environmental management system in a total of five cen-\\ntralised competence centres. Environmental improvements that \\nhave proven effective at one location are then implemented at \\nother locations to the extent possible. Regular further training \\ncourses and the exchange of experiences within the workforce \\nensure that relevant knowledge is effectively applied throughout \\nthe organisation. During the year under report, our proactive en-\\nvironmental management system again made a major contribu-\\ntion to ensuring that there were no significant environmental in-\\ncidents involving the payment of fines throughout the global pro-\\nduction network. \\nWater \\nThe BMW  Group also aims to continuously reduce water con-\\nsumption at its production plants in order to prevent potential \\nwater supply risks. With this point in mind, wastewater from the \\npaint shops and washing facilities at the assembly plants is re-\\ncycled. Moreover, slightly contaminated water (so- called “grey \\nwater”) is used as process water at the BMW  Group’s Dadong \\nvehicle plant (Shenyang, China). In regions where water is \\nscarce, the BMW Group ensures that it is used as sparingly as \\npossible. At the BMW manufacturing plant in Chennai, India, for \\nexample, rainwater is collected during the monsoon season that \\ncovers up to 100% of its water demand. vAt 1.78 m3 per vehicle \\nproduced, ↗ specific potable water consumption 2,3 in automobile pro-\\nduction was moderately below the previous year’s level due to \\nthe higher production volume (2022: 1.90 m3/-6.3%). ↗ Water \\nconsumption in detail \\nWaste \\nTo minimise the total volume of waste generated, the \\nBMW Group utilises coordinated recycling and processing con-\\ncepts that are adapted to the specific waste streams at its vari-\\nous plants, regionally applicable statutory regulations and local \\nwaste management structures. In 2023, a total of 99.4% 4 \\n(2022: 99.3%) of the waste generated by production was either \\nrecycled or recovered. The amount of ↗ waste for disposal per vehicle \\nproduced5 in the automobile production fell significantly by 22.6% \\nyear on year to 2.12  kg (2022: 2.74 kg). The BMW  Group in-\\ntends to maintain its high rates of recycling and recovery as it \\ngradually transitions to electric mobility. ↗ GRI Index: 306 -4, 306-5, \\n↗ Waste generation in detail, ↗ SASB Index \\nVOC solvent emissions \\nThe ↗ VOC solvent emissions per vehicle produced 6,7 fell again signifi-\\ncantly by 14.8% to 0.52 kg (2022: 0.61 kg) during the year un-\\nder report. Due to the progress made in the use of solvent-free \\nsubstances and the constant optimisation of painting processes, \\nwe expect to see a further slight decrease in emissions levels in \\nthe coming year. ↗ GRI Index: 305-7 \\nBiodiversity \\nThe BMW Group also takes biodiversity into account at its vari-\\nous locations worldwide. It assesses biodiversity in the context of \\nits plants, using a biodiversity indicator as an example within the \\nframework of ecological verification procedures. Based on this \\nassessment, measures to improve these habitats are then pro-\\nposed accordingly. We are also committed to protecting \\nbiodiversity in countries where our renewable raw materials are \\ngrown. In Indonesia, for instance, we therefore support local na-\\nture conservation initiatives that are dedicated to preserving nat-\\nural biodiversity via the “Living Rubber” project. We are also cur-\\nrently analysing biodiversity-related impacts as well as the op-\\nportunities and risks in order to develop corresponding targets \\nand the next steps moving forward. ↗ GRI Index: 304-2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 In accordance with the environmental management system, each operator is required to describe \\nthe environmental impacts in the aspects register and identify measures for improvement (e.g. \\nlong-term targets). \\n2 Efficiency indicator calculated from the potable water consumption measured for automobile pro-\\nduction (BMW Group plants, excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) divided by the \\nnumber of vehicles produced in automobile production (BMW Group plants and partner plants, \\nexcluding contract manufacturing). \\n3 Potable water consumption refers to water purchased from external water suppliers. If a \\nBMW Group site does not purchase water from an external supplier, the primary source of supply \\nis counted as potable water. This method of measurement applies to the BMW Group plants in \\nSan Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Araquari (Brazil) where groundwater is the main source of supply. \\n4 Waste for disposal in relation to the total weight of waste. \\n5 Efficiency indicator calculated from the waste for disposal in automobile production (BMW Group \\nplants, excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) divided by the number of vehicles \\nproduced in automobile production (BMW Group plants and partner plants, excluding contract \\nmanufacturing). \\n6 Solvent emissions (volatile organic compounds = VOC) are especially generated during the paint-\\ning process and can be reduced by deploying new painting technologies. \\n7 Efficiency indicator calculated from solvent emissions generated in automobile production \\n(BMW Group plants, excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) divided by the number \\nof vehicles produced in automobile production (BMW Group plants and partner plants, excluding \\ncontract manufacturing).

Production accounts for the \\nmajority of ↗ Scope 1 and Scope 2 emiss ions within the BMW  Group. \\nAs in the past, we remain committed to energy efficiency \\nmeasures, electricity generated in-house from renewable \\nsources, the purchase of green electricity from Power Purchase \\nAgreements and the use of Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g. \\nguarantees of origin). \\nThe remaining emissions 1 are largely attributable to the use of \\nnatural gas. In this respect, the BMW  Group faces the challenge \\nof replacing natural gas with non -fossil energy sources such as \\nbiogas, green hydrogen or green electricity. However, the transi-\\ntion to alternative energy sources depends largely on their avail-\\nability, the technical retrofitting of the systems and the political \\nframework conditions. \\nAs a further contribution to protecting the climate, the \\nBMW Group finances various climate protection projects outside \\nits own value chain, equivalent to the amount of Scope 1 and \\nScope 2 emissions remaining in 2023 as well as Scope 3 emis-\\nsions from the category “business travel”.2  \\n↗ Contribution to climate protection outside the BMW Group’s own value chain \\nEnergy management and efficiency \\nThe BMW Group continuously invests in improving the energy ef-\\nficiency of its worldwide production network. In this context, clear \\nroles – in each case with corresponding responsibilities, targets \\nand reporting obligations – are assigned to central strategy de-\\npartments, regional management units and plants at local level. \\nAfter the persistent restrictions put in place due to the corona-\\nvirus pandemic and the impact of the war in Ukraine, production \\nvolumes increased again significantly in 2023. Due to the asso-\\nciated improvement in plant capacity utilisation, specific energy \\nconsumption in automobile production fell to 1.97 MWh per ve-\\nhicle produced (2022: 2.13 MWh; -7.5%) for the year under re-\\nport. At 6,380,652 MWh, the total amount of energy consumed \\nby the BMW Group during the period under report was higher \\nthan the previous year due to production volume factors (2022: \\n6,295,990 MWh; +1.3%). ↗ Energy consumption in detail, ↗ GRI Index: \\n302-1, 302-4 \\nRenewable energy \\nAll BMW Group production sites worldwide an d the majority of \\nother BMW Group locations use green electricity, which is either \\ngenerated in-house, procured directly or using Energy Attribute \\nCertificates (e.g. guarantees of origin). \\nAt present, the BMW Group is unable to entirely cover its energy \\nneeds by generating its own renewable energy and therefore \\npurchases from renewable sources, for example via power pur-\\nchase agreements (PPAs).

The latter resulted in \\nhigher costs for the BMW Group, primarily for raw materials, \\nsemiconductors, energy and transportation. The overall supply \\nsituation also remained challenging in 2023. The supply situa-\\ntion for semiconductors in particular will remain challenging for \\ncertain technologies in the current financial year. \\n↗ Outlook, ↗ Risks \\nand Opportunities \\nNatural disasters pose an additional risk. Extensive flooding in \\nSlovenia led to delivery difficulties during the year under report. \\nThe prospect of climate change and the increasing number of \\nextreme weather events are likely to make planning more difficult \\ngoing forward. However, the BMW Group is able to mitigate the \\neffects of these unexpected events through its flexible supply \\nnetwork and thus largely ensure its ability to deliver vehicles. \\nTo lessen the impact of the war in Ukraine on its European \\nplants, since 2022 extensive measures have been in place, and \\ntherefore continues to source components from western Ukraine. \\nAt the same time, our partners have established additional pro-\\nduction sites outside Ukraine. As a result of these various \\nmeasures the supply of wiring harnesses to our plants has \\nlargely returned to normal. The situation is, however, being mon-\\nitored continually.  \\nExpanding resilient supply chains  \\nDuring the year under report, the BMW Group was generally able \\nto rely on the stability of its supply chains, despite the problems \\ncaused by geopolitical crises and the availability of critical raw \\nmaterials. Price increases on global markets also tended to in-\\ntensify the tense purchasing situation. The BMW Group RiskHub \\nplays a key role in making our global supply chains more resilient. \\nFor example, it helps to identify risks at an earlier stage through \\nthe use of artificial intelligence (AI). We see the development of \\nthe Catena-X digital ecosystem as the key to standardised data \\ntransfers throughout our supplier network. \\nThe BMW Group follows the principle of procuring vehicle com-\\nponents close to its production sites, wherever possible. We are \\ntherefore represented by local purchasing teams in all key mar-\\nkets in order to quickly identify local risks and opportunities and \\nrespond flexibly to the respective market conditions. In the face \\nof geostrategic aspects, a resilient strategy for the Group’s sup-\\nply chains is also becoming increasingly important and the \\nBMW Group takes this fact increasingly into account when se-\\nlecting its partners. \\nRegional distribution of the BMW Group’s purchased  \\nvolumes* \\nin % \\n*Direct and indirect purchasing. \\nRisk management in purchasing \\nAn interconnected risk management system is fundamental for \\nmanaging the supplier network. It takes preventative action when \\nnominating suppliers, while also reacting quickly in order to iden-\\ntify and analyse impending supply bottlenecks. The \\nBMW Group’s RiskHub analyses information from external, pub-\\nlic-ly available data sources with regard to potential risks such as \\nnatural disasters or financial risks. We also employ state-of-the-\\nart methods derived from the fields of AI and big data analytics. \\nFor selected topics such as the reliable supply of semiconductor \\ncomponents, we also take the locations of sub-suppliers into ac-\\ncount when assessing overall risk. \\nIn order to avoid cyber risks and deal effectively with an increas-\\ning number of supplier-related incidents, the BMW Group contin-\\nues to rely on supplier certification in accordance with the TISAX \\nautomotive standard. When it comes to purchasing materials \\nboth directly and indirectly, TISAX is an integral part of the pro-\\ncurement process and an inherent component of contracts with \\nsuppliers that meet the specific relevance criteria.

The long-\\nterm supply of critical raw materials required for electric mobility \\nremains a strategic challenge. Measures taken by the \\nBMW Group to increase supply security and promote the pro-\\ncurement of raw materials from responsible sources include, \\namong other things, sourcing lithium and cobalt directly. Further-\\nmore, the BMW Group analyses the development of raw materi-\\nals prices and hedges against price fluctuations – provided the \\ncapital market offers the opportunity to do so. ↗ Raw materials price \\nrisks and opportunities \\nFor the BMW Group, the responsible procurement of raw mate-\\nrials is the result of a holistic approach that takes economic, eco-\\nlogical and social aspects equally into account. Our commitment \\nto upholding environmental and social standards as well as hu-\\nman rights throughout our raw materials supply chains is set out \\nin, among other places, the ↗ BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct  in \\nwhich we oblige our Tier 1 suppliers to pass on our requirements \\nto their upstream sub-suppliers. There are also raw -materials-\\nspecific statements such as the ↗ High Level Commitment for \\nsustainable natural rubber. \\nAnnual risk analyses form the basis for implementing raw-mate-\\nrials-related preventive and remedial measures to reduce envi-\\nronmental and human rights risks. Key levers in this respect are \\nto forgo, substitute or reduce the use of primary raw materials \\nthat entail a high level of risk. The BMW Group’s secondary raw \\nmaterials strategy is of vital significance in this context: ↗ Circular \\neconomy, resource efficiency and renewable energy. We also focus in par-\\nticular on collaborating closely with our partners in the supplier \\nnetwork as well as in multistakeholder initiatives and projects. \\nWe use scientific findings to gain an even better understanding \\nof the extraction processes of raw materials and take them into \\naccount accordingly when analysing the level of risk. ↗ Lithium \\nStudy \\nAmong other things, the BMW Group focuses on the conflict min-\\nerals tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG) and uses standard-\\nised tools of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) to trace raw \\nmaterials back to the smelter. We use existing certifications for \\nother raw materials. The BMW Group is also involved in develop-\\ning certified standards for critical stages of the value chain, for \\nexample as part of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assur-\\nance (IRMA), and is engaged in their implementation by suppli-\\ners. Further details and raw materials profiles are available \\n↗ online. ↗ SASB Index \\nMoreover, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of generating a \\npositive impact for selected raw materials through our involve-\\nment in local development projects. This currently applies to the \\nraw materials lithium, mica, cobalt and natural rubber. \\nPurchasing battery cells  \\nAs of 2025, the BMW Group plans to deploy a new generation of \\nbattery cells. Against this backdrop, we have concluded contracts \\nwith our partners that guarantee us annual production capacities \\nin Europe, China and the USA. We are strategically establishing \\nsupply chains for battery cells close to our production sites, \\nthereby underpinning the “local for local” approach. During the \\nyear under report, we entered into a new partnership in North \\nAmerica to make the battery cell supply chain more resilient. \\nTo strengthen this resilience even further, we plan to anchor the \\nupstream value chain for critical components in the respective re-\\ngions while accounting for geopolitical risks and economic effi-\\nciency. Through this, the BMW Group also aims to improve its \\nresilience in the face of external events while redu cing its de-\\npendence on geopolitical factors and its exposure to related \\nrisks. \\nSecondary raw materials will be increasingly deployed to cover \\nthe BMW Group’s cobalt, lithium and nickel requirements, to-\\ngether with purchased green electricity for the latest generation \\nof battery cells. Contracts and framework agreements have al-\\nready been concluded with suppliers to this end. This will help \\nfurther reduce our carbon footprint from the new battery cell in \\nthe supply chain compared to the previous generation. ↗ Carbon \\nemissions in the supply chain \\nIn-house production as a strategic competitive advantage \\nThe BMW Group regularly examines its range of products in \\nterms of their profitability and strategic significance. The main fo-\\ncus is being directed at electric mobility, digitalisation and sus-\\ntainability. In these key areas of transformation, the BMW Group \\nis expanding its in-house expertise on a targeted and long-term \\nbasis on matters relating to strategically important components. \\nAt the same time, in-house production aims to improve both se-\\ncurity of supply and the ability to innovate. The benefits of this \\napproach have already been seen, for example, with the control \\nunit of the high-voltage storage system and scopes of the electric \\ndrive equipment. At the same time, we are looking to strengthen \\nour process competencies in technologies relevant for quality \\nmanagement and enablement within the supplier network. \\nQuality assurance \\nQuality is a promise we make to our customers as well as a de-\\ncisive competitive advantage and an essential factor for the en-\\nduring success of the BMW Group. The quality management sys-\\ntem is the basis for continuously improving the quality of our \\nproducts, processes and services. It consists of an intercon-\\nnected, comprehensive system that encompasses the entire \\nproduct development process, industrialisation and series pro-\\nduction with respect to both in-house production and the supplier \\nnetwork. The various steps are supported based on need by our \\nteams of quality experts when necessary. The ultimate aim is to \\nensure – both preventatively and systematically – that all quality \\nrequirements are met at all times. \\nInnovations \\nCollaboration with technology partners and the establishment of \\nnew networks enables us to implement innovations in our vehi-\\ncles within a very short time. In this context, we work closely with \\nthe ↗ BMW Startup Garage and ↗ BMW i Ventures.  \\nThe specialist teams cooperate in technology clusters to sharpen \\nthe focus on innovation screening, which is implemented through \\nstrategic supplier dialogue formats (Future Vision DeepDive) and \\nother means. Findings from the supplier network are systemati-\\ncally processed within the technology clusters. '),\n",

The digital platform enables par tners \\nwithin value chains to tackle key challenges facing the industry, \\nsuch as enhancing resilience, meeting sustainability goals and \\nregulatory matters through digital collaboration. After two years \\nof development work, including a significant contribution from the \\nBMW Group as consortium leader, a beta test phase was suc-\\ncessfully conducted in 2023. Among other things, pilot projects \\nwere carried out in conjunction with BMW component produc-\\ntion, providing valuable insights that will serve to promote inno-\\nvative data processing methods in a production environment. \\nCatena-X has been in the rollout phase since October 2023.  \\nThe BMW  Group is focusing mainly on component traceability \\nalong multistage supply chains, cooperative root cause analysis \\nto combat any potential quality problems and the collection of \\ncarbon-emissions-related data in the supply chains. In 2024, ef-\\nforts will be scaled up with suppliers with the aim of further im-\\nplementing and developing additional “use cases” as well as \\nscaling these for strategic relevant components through the in-\\ndustry network. Another key advancement is the provision of dig-\\nital product passports, which contain product-specific data for \\ncomponents such as batteries or even for entire vehicles. Based \\non information from th e n-tier supply chain via Catena -X, data \\nare available in particular regarding origin, material composition \\nand recycling. \\nSocial and environmental responsibility \\nThe BMW Group views responsible supply chain management \\nas an integral part of good corporat e governance The develop-\\nment of established processes was continued throughout the \\nyear under report. The BMW Group’s requirements and the ex-\\npectations it places on its suppliers are set out in the ↗ BMW Group \\nSupplier Code of Conduct  and contractually enshrined as an integral \\npart of the BMW  Group’s Terms and Conditions of Purchase. \\n↗ GRI Index: 2-23, 3-3, 407-1, 408-1 \\nThe BMW  Group’s overarching approach to respecting human \\nrights and upholding social standards along the entire value \\nchain is provided in the chapter on ↗ Compliance and Human Rights. \\nDue diligence in the supplier network  \\nOur corporate responsibility for environmental and social stand-\\nards in the supply chain is institutionalised as part of a multi-\\nstage due diligence process. We mainly use standardised control \\nprocedures to carry out the due diligence obligations incorpo-\\nrated in our business processes. The BMW  Group also cooper-\\nates with initiatives and associations such as the Responsible \\nBusiness Alliance (RBA) and Drive Sustainability. In this context, \\nwe follow the guidelines developed by the German Automotive \\nIndustry Dialogue. We also remain committed to establishing an \\nindustry-wide complaints mechanism, among other things. \\n― Risk analysis  \\nThe BMW Group monitors and assesses the sustainability risks \\nin its supplier network in business relationships at both potential \\nand active supplier locations. In order to identify and assess ab-\\nstract environmental and human rights risks, various internal and \\nexternal data sources such as country- and product-group-spe-\\ncific indicators as well as media analyses at Group and location \\nlevel are drawn upon. The BMW Group uses standardised sus-\\ntainability surveys and commissions external on-site audits (as-\\nsessments) to conduct in-depth risk analyses for its Tier 1 sup-\\npliers. Supply chain mapping forms the basis for analysing risks \\nat n-Tier suppliers. The BMW Group continuously endeavours to \\nincrease transparency along the entire supply chain. ↗ GRI Index: \\n2-24, 308-1, 414-1 \\n― Prevention and remediation \\nPrior to signing a contract with the BMW  Group, if any risks are \\nidentified in the course of the specific risk analysis, our suppliers \\nare required to implement or expand the necessary preventive or \\nremediation and control measures by an agreed target date. Our \\nsuppliers are also required to request these from their subcon-\\ntractors based on their respective risks. The measures, which are \\nqueried, validated and evaluated as part of the sourcing process \\nusing the industry-wide questionnaire from ↗ Drive Sustainability , \\nserve to minimise potential risks or eliminate existing deficien-\\ncies. ↗ Further GRI  information, ↗ Sustainability assessment of relevant \\nsupplier locations This online assessment is performed for suppliers \\nof production-related goods and services with a contract volume \\nover a certain threshold. Different modules are used depending \\non the size of the company being assessed. Implementation \\nmust be successfully completed prior to the start of production. \\nFor suppliers of non-production-related goods and services, this \\nprocedure is also carried out depending on country- and product-\\ngroup-specific risks. The extent of the preventive measures is \\nbased on the potential risks, the nature and scope of the busi-\\nness activity and the size of the supplier. In addition, we offer \\ntraining courses on sustainability in the supply chain, some of \\nwhich are mandatory for internal purchasers. These trainings \\nalso address process partners and suppliers on a voluntary ba-\\nsis. \\nThe BMW Group has put additional control mechanisms in place \\nfor suppliers in high-risk regions or high-risk product groups. Key \\ninstruments in this respect are audits of environmental and social \\nstandards at supplier locations using cross-industry assessment \\nprogrammes provided by the Responsible Business Alliance \\n(RBA) and the Responsible Supply Chain Initiative (RSCI) of the \\nVDA. The BMW Group reviewed a total of 95 potential and active \\nsupplier locations using this method during the reporting year \\n(2022: 49). The BMW Group has set itself the goal that all Tier 1 \\nsupplier sites that have been assessed meet the locally applica-\\nble statutory requirements for sustainability as well as interna-\\ntional human rights standards (BMW Group minimum require-\\nments). In 2023, 17 of the 19 closure assessments confirmed \\nthat all cases of non -compliance with minimum requirements \\n(priority non -conformities) that were identified in initial '),\n",

In two cases, the closure as-\\nsessment carried out was  not immediately able to confirm that \\nthe agreed measures had been implemented. However, together \\nwith the suppliers the BMW Group has now implemented these \\nmeasures, which will be reviewed by means of a new assess-\\nment in 2024. ↗ GRI Index: 2-24, 308-2, 414-2 \\n― Effectiveness and complaint mechanisms \\nInformation on possible violations of the BMW Group’s sustaina-\\nbility requirements in the supplier network can be submitted via \\nthe BMW Group Human Rights Contact Supply Chain, among \\nother options. We also use the standardised RBA Voices com-\\nplaint mechanism as a complementary measure. Moreover, \\nwhistle-blower systems are in place to detect and report possible \\nstatutory violations. Our aim is to ensure that all substantiated \\nreports of environmental or human rights violations are rectified \\nby agreeing on remediation measures. Further information on \\nwhistle-blower systems at the BMW  Group can be found in the \\nchapter ↗ Compliance and Human Rights and on the ↗ website. \\nIf necessary, the BMW Group temporarily suspends a given busi-\\nness relationship during efforts to mitigate the detected risk. \\nHowever, the business relationship will only be terminated if no \\nother effective means are available and we are unable to further \\nleverage our ability to exert influence. We endeavour to avoid this \\nlatter situation by carefully selecting our suppliers and empower-\\ning and working with them to improve their sustainability perfor-\\nmance. No existing supplier relationships needed to be termi-\\nnated due to serious sustainability violations during the year un-\\nder report. ↗ GRI Index: 2-24, 3-3, 308-1, 414-1 \\nCarbon emissions in the supply chain \\nThe BMW Group aims to actively promote decarbonisation in its \\nown supply chain and ↗ reduce carbon emissions along the entire value \\nchain. For this re ason, one of our sourcing criteria requires that \\nsuppliers commit to undertaking decarbonisation measures.\\u200a1 We \\nspecifically enable our suppliers with online training via the \\nBMW Group Partner Academy and additionally provide face -to-\\nface formats for partner workshops at the BMW  Group plant in \\nLandshut (Germany) as well as other locations. ↗ GRI Index: 3-3 \\nIn 2023, the number of contractual agreements with suppliers \\nthat specified decarbonisation measures rose to 707 (2022: \\n468), Including those specifying the use of secondary raw mate-\\nrials, biomaterials and carbon-reduced steel. In our view, how-\\never, the use of green electricity has the greatest impact on de-\\ncarbonising the supply chain2. Accordin gly, the BMW  Group \\nspecifies its use by direct suppliers (Tier 1) and for energy-inten-\\nsive processes in the upstream supply chain (n -Tier) as a crite-\\nrion for awarding new contracts to supply carbon-intensive com-\\nponents and materials. During the year under report, we con-\\ncluded agreements of this kind for 676 contracts (2022: 343 \\ncontracts). In addition, since mid-2021 the BMW Group has con-\\ncluded numerous framework agreements with suppliers regard-\\ning the use of green electricity.2 In 2023, the BMW Group had 72 \\nvalid green electricity framework agreements in place with its \\nlargest suppliers (2022: 46). During the year under report, we \\ndeveloped an approach to review suppliers’ concepts for the use \\nof green electricity even prior to series production. \\nFurthermore, we continue to engage an external service provider \\nto carry out annual reviews relating to decarbonisation measures \\nin series production. In the course of 2023, the BMW  Group re-\\nviewed compliance with contractually agreed decarbonisation \\nmeasures in the supply chain at 72 suppliers (2022: 23). As a \\nresult, the BMW Group reduced the volume of carbon emissions \\ngenerated in the supply chain by around 1.7 million t CO2e during \\nthe reporting period. In 2023, carbon emissions generated in the \\nsupply chain and via logistics on behalf of the BMW Group world-\\nwide averaged 13.9 t CO2e per vehicle produced (t CO2e)3. As ex-\\npected, the gradual electrification of the fleet leads to a rise in \\nemissions generated in the supply chain. We assume that the \\ncurrent upward trend will reverse by 2026 at the latest thanks to \\nthe implementation of carbon-reducing measures. \\nWe continue to rely on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Sup-\\nply Chain Programme to assess the performance of the supply \\nchain in terms of its decarbonisation. This helps suppliers to de-\\nfine their decarbonisation targets, integrate these into their busi-\\nness processes and report on the actual reductions achieved. \\nTheir efforts are linked to a rating from which we derive measures \\nfor supplier development and empowerment. In 2023, 282 sup-\\npliers took part in the rating (84% of the production-relevant pur-\\nchasing volume). \\n1 The BMW Group includes measures that reduce carbon emissions, such as the use of green elec-\\ntricity, the use of secondary raw materials, new manufacturing processes for raw materials, and \\nproduct and material innovations such as biomaterials. Accordingly, compensation measures are \\nnot included. \\n2 In-house generation, direct purchase or Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g. guarantees of origin). \\n3 The procedure for determining the key figures is explained in the glossary.

This means \\nthat 99.80%2 (2022: 99.79 %) of employees and 100% (2022: \\n99.98%) of temporary employees at BMW Group plants work at \\na site covered by an international occupational health and safety \\nmanagement system. The BMW Group plant in Manaus (Brazil, \\ncertification planned for 2024), the contract manufacturing facil-\\nities in Born (the Netherlands, production will end in 2024) and \\nthe jointly managed Spotlight plant in Zhangjiagang (certification \\nplanned for 2024) are not currently certified. \\nThe BMW Group has set the goal of obtaining certification to one \\nof the aforementioned international standards for all of its plants \\nby 2025. Employer and employee representatives work together \\nat nearly all locations to bring about a continual improvement in \\nhealth and safety standards. ↗ GRI Index: 403-1, 403-4, 403-8 \\nRecognising and avoiding risks \\nThe BMW Group conducts comprehensive risk and stress ana -\\nlyses in order to identify potential work-related risks in both pro-\\nduction and office workplaces. With the Digital Workplace Stress \\nManagement (DWSM) project – a fully automated ergonomics \\nassessment – the BMW Group continues to set standards in the \\nautomotive industry. Over the last two years, ergonomics spe-\\ncialists from the BMW Group have been training employees in \\nthe use of DWSM at all assembly locations in Germany. Prepa-\\nrations have also been made at the locations in Mexico, the UK, \\nthe USA and South Africa for the implementation of DWSM.  \\nThe BMW  Group regularly assesses all methods and instru-\\nments used within the Company. The results of the assessments \\nare subsequently used to enhance internal norms. The Works \\nCouncil and, if necessary, the representatives of severely disa-\\nbled employees and HR management are involved. \\nThe BMW Group ensures the quality of its processes by means \\nof annual internal audits. Audits and certifications of sites are \\nconducted by external service providers. All necessary audits \\nwere again successfully performed in 2023. The results and re-\\nsulting measures are made available to all BMW Group locations. \\n↗ GRI Index: 403-2, 403-7 \\nAccident frequency at a low level \\nThe BMW Group’s preventive measures continue to have an im-\\npact. In 2023, these also meant that the accident frequency rate \\nremained at a low level of 2.0 (2022: 1.93). There were no fatal \\naccidents during the reporting year (2022: no fatal accidents). \\n↗ Further GRI Information, ↗ GRI -Index: 403-9 \\nAccident frequency rate4  \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\nOccupational safety along the value chain \\nCooperation with contractual partners on safety-related aspects \\nat the sites is regulated by way of a separate contractor declara-\\ntion.

Key princi-\\nples such as protection against discrimination, equal treatment \\nof all employees and respect at all times are firmly embedded in \\nthe \\n↗ BMW Group Code of Conduct  and the ↗ BMW Group Code of Human \\nRights and Working Conditions. \\nEqual opportunities at the BMW Group are also expressed in a \\nremuneration system that is designed to be independent of gen-\\nder, religious denomination, origin, age, disability, sexual orien-\\ntation or country-specific characteristics. In the reporting year, \\nBMW AG was the first German company to be certified as a Fair \\nPay Leader by the Fair Pay Innovation Lab (FPI). The certifica-\\ntion is evidence that BMW AG’s remuneration structures are ef-\\nfective in ensuring equal salaries between women and men. This \\nis supported by annual, science-based equal pay analyses, a \\npractice which the BMW Group also aims to expand to interna-\\ntional locations in the future. \\n↗ GRI Index: 405-2 \\nAll employees can contact their managers, the relevant specialist \\ndepartments, the HR department, the Works council and the rep-\\nresentative body for employees with disabilities with concerns \\nrelating to diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion.

A key component is web-based \\ntraining against discrimination in the workplace. This training has \\nbeen mandatory for all employees in Germany since 2023. From \\n2024, all BMW Group employees will be offered anti-discrimina-\\ntion training. We have also introduced measures such as the \\n↗ Senior Expert Programme  and the Joint Leadership Programme, \\nwhich were used with increasing frequency in 2023. The BMW \\nGroup also commissioned an external analysis of its existing \\ncommitments, with a focus on the dimensions of sexual orienta-\\ntion and identity. This took place within the framework of our \\nmembership with “PROUT AT WORK”, a leading foundation and \\nconsultancy in Germany focusi ng on LGBTIQ+3 issues in the \\nworkplace, aimed at promoting equality for individuals within the \\nqueer community. We will use this as the basis for specific \\nmeasures in the next step. \\nThe established “Diversity Week” was expanded in 2023 to be-\\ncome the international “Days of Diversity” for the first time. \\nThroughout the year, numerous activities – such as lectures, \\nworkshops and interactive events for employees – took place at \\nour locations worldwide, including special events on International \\nWomen’s Day and the International Days of Cultural Diversity \\nand Tolerance. In the reporting year, we also implemented \\nmeasures that were adopted in 2022 as part of the revised ver-\\nsion of BMW AG’s general operating and inclusion agreement for \\nemployees with disabilities. Examples of this include our require-\\nments for barrier-free access in the areas of Manufacture and IT. \\nAs in previous years, BMW  AG in Germany awarded contracts \\namounting to around €  42.7 million (2022: € 41.1 million) in \\n2023 to workshops staffed by people with disabilities. \\n1 Direct: Clock-controlled and production employees. \\n2 Indirect: All employees not engaged in clock-controlled work. \\n3 Abbreviation for all sexual orientations and forms of identity.

As such, we not only live up to our own aspirations but \\nalso the expectations of society and our stakeholders worldwide. \\nThe BMW Group aims to act in a targeted, long -term and effec-\\ntive manner. We also provide quick and unbureaucratic assis-\\ntance in the event of a crisis. We have defined four key topics that \\nare reflected in our projects on the basis of our core business and \\nskill sets: \\n― Inclusion for equal opportunities \\nThe BMW Group is a partner of the ↗ Intercultural Innovation Hub (IIH). \\nThis platform has emerged from our long- standing partnership \\nwith the UN Alliance of Civilizations and supports selected organ-\\nisations around the world that are engaged in concrete projects \\npromoting intercultural dialogue, peace and diversity, among \\nother initiatives. For this purpose, they receive support for over a \\nyear in the form of expertise, networking opportunities and finan-\\ncial resources. The ↗ currently funded projects were honoured at an \\nevent in Berlin in May 2023. \\nWe also contribute, for example, by supporting the ↗ JOBLINGE \\nprogramme. The initiative helps people with a difficult start in life \\nto begin their professional lives. \\n― Responsible Leadership for sustainable development \\nThe BMW  Group wants to support and bring together people \\nwho are committed to societal needs. The annual One Young \\nWorld Summit represents an international networking oppor-\\ntunity. The BMW Group has been sending a delegation of young \\nmanagers to the global forum for sustainable development since \\n2016, including in 2023. Selected IIH organisations also had the \\nopportunity to take part in the international event. \\nTo support young talent, the BMW Group awards full-time schol-\\narships for the Global Online Master in Business Administration \\n(MBA) at the ↗ European School of Management and Technology (ESMT) \\nBerlin as part of the ↗ BMW Group Change Maker Fellowships. In addition, \\nthe ↗ BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt expands our network with more \\nthan 2,300 Responsible Leaders from over 100 countries on all \\ncontinents. As an important partner, the independent corporate \\nfoundation contributes with its activities to the perception of so-\\ncial responsibility at the BMW Group. \\n― Education for future generations \\nThe BMW Group has been supporting educational projects at its \\nlocations worldwide for many years. With ↗ BRIDGE. We are taking the \\nnext step with Educating young people for tomorrow, today  – a global and \\nlong-term collaboration with UNICEF that started in 2023. The \\ncollaboration aims to qualify young people in Brazil, China, India, \\nMexico and South Africa for careers in the mathematical and \\ntechnical fields, while also collecting donations for the education \\nof children and adolescents in crisis areas within existing plat-\\nforms, and with the involvement of international subsidiaries and \\nstakeholders. The BMW Group is thereby making a long-term \\ncontribution to UNICEF’s goal of reaching more than ten million \\nchildren and adolescents through education. By undertaking this \\ncommitment, we are simultaneously implementing our corporate \\ncitizenship strategy at the local level, for example, through men-\\ntoring and internship opportunities directly at our locations. \\n― Culture and Sports for a united world  \\nThe BMW Group supports numerous sports and cultural activi-\\nties worldwide. For example, the “Opera for All” initiative pro-\\nvides free access to opera and classical music in Munich, Berlin, \\nMelbourne and London. In the context of our sports sponsor-\\nships, we also contribute, for example, through the scholarship \\nprogramme of the ↗ Evans Scholars Foundation  in conjunction with \\nthe BMW Championships golf tournament. \\nValuing and supporting employee commitment \\nThe\\n BMW Group promotes and encourages empl oyees to sup-\\nport social issues around the world in various ways through its \\nSOCIAL DRIVE initiative. The first pillar is the annual BMW Group \\nAWARD for social commitment, which has recognised the out-\\nstanding commitment of individual employees for 12 years. Of \\nthe ten finalists in 2023, four emerged as winners – one of whom \\nalso won the special Doppelfeld Foundation prize. The prize \\nmoney of € 10,000 each will be used to fund the relevant charity \\nprojects. The second pillar is the SOCIAL DRIVE IT platform, \\nwhich informs employees about specific support needs. The \\nplatform launched in Germany in 2022 and is currently being \\nrolled out internationally. With our employees’ help, we can also \\nprovide more comprehensive support for existing projects, for ex-\\nample through volunteer work and monetary donations. The \\nthird pillar is the SOCIAL DRIVE DAYS, which are intended to \\nstrengthen our employees’ interest in social commitment. \\nCorporate citizenship with impact \\nThe BMW Group’s expenditure within the strategic focus areas \\nin 2023 totalled € 44.2 million (2022: € 38.7 million). This in-\\ncludes donations for those affected by earthquakes in Turkey, \\nSyria and China, as well as fires in Hawaii and the floods in Italy. \\nBeyond financial support, the BMW  Group also provides assis-\\ntance in the form of knowledge transfer, networking opportuni-\\nties, projects to promote public infrastructure, and the engage-\\nment of its own workforce. We also generate additional societal \\nimpact through memberships in associations and institutions, \\nthe provision of vehicles, including for vocational schools, and \\nparticipation in projects aimed at promoting more sustainable \\nmobility in cities. ↗ Shaping the future of mobility  In doing so, we aim \\nto contribute as corporate citizens and play our part in address-\\ning major future questions and challenges. ]] '),\n",

In line with the \\nGroup’s performance management, the outlook covers a period \\nof one year. Short-term risks and opportunities are managed on \\nthe basis of a two-year assessment period. In addition, we report \\non medium- and long-term risks and opportunities arising in con-\\nnection with climate change. \\nThe continuous forecasting process applied within the \\nBMW Group ensures that it is constantly ready to take advantage \\nof opportunities as they arise, but also to react appropriately to \\nany unexpected risks. The principal ↗ Risks and Opportunities are de-\\nscribed in detail in the section of the same name and concern all \\nperformance indicators. Actual outcomes may, however, deviate \\nfrom the outlook due to unexpected events. \\nEconomic outlook \\nThe International Monetary Fund anticipates global growth of \\n3.1% in 2024.  Geopolitical conflicts and the effects of tighter \\nmonetary policy in many countries will be the greatest burdens \\non the global economy in 2024. Higher interest rates are affect-\\ning consumer spending and investment, with a corresponding ef-\\nfect on the economy. Further information on political and global \\neconomic risks is also available in the ↗ Risks and Opportunities sec-\\ntion.  \\nForecasts for the eurozone as a whole indicate slight growth \\n(+0.6%). France (+0.7%), Italy (+0.5%) and Spain (+1.6%) are \\nexpected to meet or outstrip the average for the eurozone. Ger-\\nmany is expected to record at least a slight increase in economic \\noutput in 2024 (+0.3%), although the continued modest growth \\nin the global economy is dampening the country’s export econ-\\nomy. \\nA slight uptick in economic output (+0.4%) is forecast for the UK, \\nwhere higher interest rates and continued higher inflation are \\nslowing growth. \\nThe growth rate in the USA is expected to slow to 1.8% in 2024. \\nHigher interest rates are burdening companies and private \\nhouseholds in that country as well, while continually low unem-\\nployment levels are supporting the economy. \\nGrowth is expected to reach 4.6% in China, where continued up-\\nheaval in the real estate sector and the resulting drop in con-\\nsumer confidence are dampening expectations. \\nThe Japanese economy is expected to see slower growth in \\n2024 than in the previous year (+0.8%). \\nCurrency markets and international interest rate \\nenvironment \\nCurrencies of particular importance for the international opera-\\ntions of the BMW Group are the Chinese renminbi, the British \\npound, the US dollar, the Japanese yen an d the South Korean \\nwon.  \\nIt is expected that inflation in the US and in Europe will continue \\nto fall, and the BMW Group therefore does not expect any further \\ninterest rate hikes from central banks. Accordingly, the US dollar \\nis expected to move sideways against the euro in 2024, with the \\npound/euro exchange rate also expected to remain stable. \\nIt is possible that Japan’s highly expansionary monetary policy \\nmay come to an end in 2024. If it does, the yen would appreciate \\nsomewhat against the euro compared to its current very low \\nlevel.  \\nLow inflation in China could lead to a more expansionary mone-\\ntary policy on the part of the central bank of China, potentially \\nresulting in a depreciation of the renminbi against the euro.  \\nThe currencies of emerging countries such as India and Brazil \\nmay benefit from the monetary policies of the EU and USA sta-\\nbilising in 2024. No further devaluations against the euro and US \\ndollar are therefore expected at present. \\nInternational automobile markets \\nThe generally stable macroeconomic conditions should allow for \\nslight growth on international automobile markets in 2024 \\n(+ 3.9%). Growth is expected to be spread across many mar-\\nkets, particularly the US and China. A higher global supply of new \\nvehicles is, however, expected to give rise to increasing price \\ncompetition, which will also have an effect on prices for pre-\\nowned vehicles. \\nInternational motorcycle markets \\nThe BMW Group expects the world’s motorcycle markets in the \\n500 cc plus class to remain in line with the previous year overall \\nin 2024. In Europe, market growth is also expected to be in line \\nwith last year's level, with a slight decrease forecast in the USA. \\nEconomic expectations will influence the motorcycle market in \\nChina, while the motorcycle market in Brazil is expected to re-\\nmain in a stable condition in 2024, as in the previous year. \\n  \\nOUTLOOK  \"),\n",

A challenging competitive en-\\nvironment and macroeconomic and geopolitical developments \\ncould all have a significant impact on business performance. The \\nclose cooperation between our sales network and our production \\nnetwork and our flexible vehicle architecture allow us to respond \\nto even unforeseeable developments effectively. ↗ Risks and \\nOpportunities \\nAssumptions used in the outlook \\nThe outlook contains forward -looking statements based on the \\nBMW Group’s expectations and assessments and may be influ-\\nenced by unforeseeable events. As a result, actual outcomes can \\ndeviate either positively or negatively from the expectations de-\\nscribed below due to changes in the political and economic envi-\\nronment as well as other factors. \\nThe following outlook covers a forecast period of one year and is \\nbased on the composition of the BMW  Group during that time. \\nThe outlook takes account of all information available at the time \\nof reporting that could have an impact on the BMW Group’s  \\nperformance. \\nThe expectations contained in the outlook are based on the \\nBMW Group’s forecast for 2024 and reflect its status at the time \\nof preparation of the Group Financial Statements. The basis for \\nthe preparation of and the principal assumptions used in the \\nforecasts – which consider the consensual opinions of leadi ng \\norganisations, such as economic research institutes and banks – \\nare set out below. The BMW  Group’s outlook takes account of \\nthese assumptions. \\nIt is expected that a fall in inflation and stabilised interest rates in \\nmany countries will allow for a slight increase in demand in 2024. \\nThe number of vehicle deliveries is set to increase slightly against \\nthis backdrop and in light of the full availability of new models \\nsuch as the BMW 7 Series and the BMW 5 Series, model \\nlaunches such as the BMW X2 and BMW X3, and the renewal of \\nthe MINI product range. Pricing across the product portfolio is ex-\\npected to remain at prior year’s level. \\nThe BMW Group anticipates an improved situation on the com-\\nmodity markets in 2024 in light of the downward price trend for \\nprecious metals and battery materials in the second half of 2023. \\nThe continued rise in all- electric and electrified vehicle numbers \\ndoes, however, mean that expenditure will remain at a high level. \\nHigher costs for employees are expected in 2024, along with \\nhigher costs from the supply chain, owing to high inflation in pre-\\nvious years.  \\nIn addition, the continued implementation of the electrification \\nand digitalisation strategy will lead to greater research and de-\\nvelopment costs in 2024. Expenditure related to the NEUE \\nKLASSE, such as the further development of the sixth generation \\nof battery technology and manufacturing preparations in the pro-\\nduction network, will also impact the Group’s earnings and result \\nin greater capital expenditure.  \\nThe situation in the Mi ddle East became increasingly volatile at \\nthe end of 2023. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is not \\nhaving a significant effect on the BMW Group’s business at pre-\\nsent as the Group does not operate directly in that region. How-\\never, it must be assumed that the threat posed in the Red Sea by \\nthe Houthi militia will cause some logistical challenges in 2024. \\nOur outlook does not account for any further escalation of the sit-\\nuation. The BMW Group is monitoring developments. \\nThe war in Ukraine and its potential implications for the \\nBMW Group’s course of business are also being closely moni-\\ntored. All applicable restrictions resulting from sanctions have \\nbeen factored into the outlook.  \\nIn view of the growing unpredictability of political developments, \\nactual macroeconomic and geopolitical developments in some \\nregions may deviate from expected trends and outcomes. Poten-\\ntial sources of political uncertainty include policies affecting trade \\nand customs tariffs, security developments and a possible wors-\\nening of international trade conflicts. \\nOutlook for the BMW Group – key performance indicators \\nDeliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls -Royce brand vehicles in the \\nAutomotive segment are expected to rise slightly year -on-year \\ndue to a slight increase in demand, full availability of new models \\nand model launches. In this context, the share of all-electric ve-\\nhicles relative to total deliveries is expected to increase signifi-\\ncantly compared to 2023. \\nAn EBIT margin of between 8 and 10% is forecast for the Auto-\\nmotive segment in 2024. The RoCE for the Automotive segment \\nis also being affected by the increasing investment in electrifica-\\ntion and digitalisation, and expected to be between 15 and 20%.  \\nThe BMW Group expects to achieve its target of slightly reducing \\nthe carbon emissions generated by its EU new vehicle fleet by \\nfurther improving the overall fuel consumption of its products and \\ndeploying an increasing number of vehicles with electric \\ndrivetrain systems.

For this purpose, the \\npotential earnings impact of the risks is aggregated, taking cor-\\nrelation effects into account. In order to assess the risk-bearing \\ncapacity of the BMW  Group, the aggregated amount of risks is \\ncompared with the risk cover amount (the equity of the \\nBMW Group recognised for accounting purposes). A limit system \\nfor various risks helps monitor the risk-bearing capacity. \\nReputational risks \\nQuite apart from the financial consequences, risks can also have \\nan impact on the BMW Group’s reputation. For these purposes, \\nthe BMW Group assesses all material risks with regard to their \\nimpact on its reputation using a scoring model. Moreover, oth er \\noverarching topics are monitored by means of regular media \\nanalysis. Any material reputational repercussions are described \\nin the section ↗ Material Short-Term Risks and Opportunities. \\nClimate-related risks \\nRisks associated with climate change are presented in the sec-\\ntion ↗ Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities. Climate-related risks are \\nevaluated as physical and transitory risks in accordance with the \\nrecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Finan-\\ncial Disclosures (TCFD). Transitory risks arise from the transition \\nto a low-carbon economy and are evaluated with the help of cli-\\nmate-related risk drivers and qualitative expert assessments. \\nPhysical risks arise due to climate change and are evaluated us-\\ning external data on potential natural hazards. Potential short -\\nterm impacts of climate change are already included in the short-\\nterm risks. All short-term risks are evaluated for their climate im-\\npact. If a risk is categorised as climate -relevant, the climate-re-\\nlated portion of the risk is determined. The potential development \\nof climate-related risks is evaluated for two reporting periods \\n(medium-term until 2035 and long -term until 2050) and for \\nthree global warming scenarios. \\nNon-financial risks as reported in the non-financial \\nstatement (NFS) \\nAlongside the maintenance of a comprehensive system of risk \\nmanagement, sustainability constitutes a core strategic principle \\nof the BMW Group. Risks resulting from sustainability issues are \\ngenerally identified via the Group -wide risk management \\nnetwork. \\nIn accordance with §  289c of the German Commercial Code \\n(HGB), risks that could have an impact on the non -financial as-\\npects referred to in the relevant legislation are reviewed as part \\nof the reporting process. Material risks in this context are defined \\nas those stemming from business activities, business relation-\\nships and products and services provided by the BMW Group \\nthat are highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact. No ma-\\nterial non-financial risks were identified during the reporting year. \\nOpportunity management \\nIdentifying opportunities is an integral part of the BMW  Group’s \\nstrategic planning process. The Group’s range of products and \\nservices is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses. \\nThe continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict \\ncost controls are also essential factors for ensuring high levels of \\nprofitability and returns on capital employed. \\nThe importance of short -term opportunities for the BMW Group \\nis classified on a qualitative basis in the categories “material” and \\n“immaterial”.

As in the previous \\nyear, the current set of risks to the BMW Group are considered to \\nbe manageable.

The level of risk continues to be \\nclassified as high. \\nWith regard to the war in Ukraine, there is a risk of a further es-\\ncalation of the conflict and therefore of further sanctions imposed \\nby Western countries on Russia as well as possible counter-\\nsanctions and/or retaliatory measures by Russia. Withdrawal of \\nUS support for Ukraine could have major ramifications for the \\ncourse of the war.  \\nFurther escalation of the conflict in the Middle East could nega-\\ntively impact the price of oil, which in turn could lead to rising in-\\nflation rates. \\nIn the trade war between the US and China, the focus is currently \\nshifting from simple tariff increases to further import and export \\nrestrictions on specific technologies. This could also lead to less \\nfavourable import and export conditions for the BMW Group. \\nWith the recent anti -dumping and anti-subsidy probe launched \\nagainst China (the EU is examining, among other things, whether \\nsubsidies for electric vehicles produced in China lead to distorted \\ncompetition), the EU is also considering imposing punitive tariffs \\non the People’s Republic, which in turn increases the risk of a \\ntrade war between the two parties. An escalation of the conflict \\ncould have negative consequences for trade between Europe \\nand China, resulting in both sales risks and risks in the supply \\nchain. \\nAnother risk is of rec ession in Europe and the United States. In \\nboth regions, interest rates were raised considerably in order to \\ncurb inflation. Inflation rates have significantly decreased by this \\npoint and the majority of economies have continued to grow de-\\nspite the interest rate hikes – labour markets have shown partic-\\nular resilience. However, monetary policy measures such as in-\\nterest rate hikes often take effect with some delay and could \\ntherefore slow down the economy in 2024, posing a risk to sales. \\nThe present fragility of the Chinese economy also represents a \\nrisk to sales. If the situation in the real estate sector were to de-\\nteriorate further, the potential impacts on the economy would be \\nsignificantly felt. \\nTo mitigate the effects, sales markets are being monitored on an \\nongoing basis, and individual measures are being defined by \\nstandardised processes and committees. \\nAt the moment, macroeconomic opportunities that could influ-\\nence the earnings situation of the BMW Group positively in the \\nlong term are rather unlikely to materialise. If significantly more \\npositive economic development were to occur in a market due to \\nstronger fiscal or monetary policy measures, this could certainly \\nhave a positive impact.  \\nStrategic and sector-specific risks and opportunities \\nChanges in legislation and regulatory requirements \\nThe introduction of more stringent legislation and regulations, \\nparticularly regarding emissions, safety and consumer protection \\nas well as regional vehicle-related purchase and usage taxes, \\nposes a significant risk for the automobile industry.  \\nCountry- and sector-specific trade barriers can also be subject to \\nchange at short notice. Any tightening up of regulations could ne-\\ncessitate significantly increased investments and costs, influence \\ncustomer behaviour, and lead to interruptions in supply. The risk \\nis categorised as high. \\nThe BMW  Group is seeing increasingly stringent vehicle emis-\\nsions regulations for conventional drive systems. In December \\n2023, a political deal was reached in the EU on the Euro 7 reg-\\nulation. Risks may arise from the details of the regulation still to \\nbe finalised by the European Commission. In addition to pollutant \\nemissions, brake particle emissions, tyre abrasion and high-volt-\\nage battery durability (BEV, PHEV) are also being regulated for \\nthe first time. Following the implementation of Euro 7, additional \\ntargeted tightening measures are anticipated around 2030. \\nThe legally required fleet-wide carbon emissions target in the EU \\nhas been reduced to 0 g/km for 2035, thus requiring complete \\nelectrification of the passenger car new vehicle fleet by 2035. \\nMoreover, the European Commission is working on a proposal to \\ndetermine if and how vehicles powered exclusively by e-fuels can \\nbe recognised as zero-emission vehicles. In 2026, a review will \\ntake place during which the necessary framework conditions to \\nachieve the zero emissions target in 2035 will be analysed. Risks \\ncan arise from the availability of renewable energies, inadequate \\nprivate and public charging infrastructure as well as limited ac-\\ncess to resources for the construction of electric drives. A discus-\\nsion of consumption values and carbon emissions may have an \\nimpact on the Company’s reputation. \\nChanges in trade policies could also have a positive impact on \\nthe BMW Group’s earnings in the short to medium term. Any re-\\nduction in tariff barriers, import restrictions or direct excise duties \\ncould result in lower manufacturing costs or enable products and \\nservices to be offered to customers at more attractive prices. Op-\\nportunities potentially arising from changes in legislation and \\nregulations are classified as immaterial. \\nMarket developments \\nThe constant change in consumer preferences or an altered \\nbrand perception pose both risks and opportunities. For instance, \\nthe BMW Group could be confronted with short-term disruptions \\nin both supply and demand during the transition from conven-\\ntionally powered vehicles to alternative drive systems.

Opportunities arising as a result are classified \\nas immaterial. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to production and technologies \\nPlant downtime is the main risk affecting production. Disruptions \\nto production can have various causes, including equipment and \\ntool shortages, supplier bottlenecks, scarcity or shortages of pro-\\nduction resources such as gas or electricity, as well as problems \\nwith logistics. Furthermore, IT disruptions caused by cyber - \\nattacks, for example, are playing an increasingly significant role \\nin disruptions to the supply chain and production. Damage to the \\nfactory infrastructure, caused by fire or natural events such as \\nhail, storms or heavy rainfall, can lead to production downtime. \\nThe risk level for the occurrence of such risks is assessed as high. \\nAll BMW  Group plants have implemented measures for risk \\navoidance and reduction. These include, for example, predictive \\nmaintenance. The risk of production downtime due to parts sup-\\nply is reduced via measures related to logistics, purchasing and \\nthe use of the production network.  \\nA variety of measures are also being taken to prevent and coun-\\nteract longer downtimes of manufacturing equipment due to tar-\\ngeted cyberattacks. \\nPotential natural hazards are already taken into account when \\nselecting a site and through the implementation of measures \\nduring construction. The risk posed by natural hazards or fire is \\nreduced by the use of on-site fire services and employee training. \\nRisks resulting from property -related damage and damage due \\nto downtime, as well as transport damage to vehicles already \\nmanufactured, are transferred to highly solvent ins urance com-\\npanies. Due to the volatility of the international insurance mar-\\nkets, the BMW Group itself bears significant risks today. This so-\\nlution may become increasingly relevant if premiums and de-\\nductibles continue to rise. \\nPotential short-term changes to the relevant legislation and reg-\\nulations or changes in their national interpretation by the author-\\nities may jeopardise our ability to receive type approvals in good \\ntime and, in extreme cases, may lead to the non -admission of a \\nvehicle derivative, sub-market or even a complete market. This, \\nalong with a delayed start of production for new models, could \\nlead to sales losses. Numerous control points have been imple-\\nmented as part of the homologation process in order to identify \\nand mitigate risks. \\nProduct recalls can lead to additional costs. The BMW Group es-\\ntablishes appropriate provisions for statutory and non -statutory \\nwarranty obligations. It cannot be ruled out, however, that addi-\\ntional costs could be incurred that are either not covered or not \\nfully covered by these provisions. Despite the deployment of \\nthorough quality assurance processes, such risks can always \\narise if the materials and/or processing procedures used prove \\ninsufficient – in some cases years after a product has been \\nlaunched. A high number of recalls could also have a negative \\nimpact on the BMW  Group’s reputation. Further information on \\nrisks in conjunction with provisions for statutory and non -statu-\\ntory warranty obligations is provided in ↗ Note [34] to the Group \\nFinancial Statements. \\nThe BMW Group sees opportunities relating to production pro-\\ncesses primarily in the competitive edge gained from mastering \\nnew and complex technologies. Given the long lead times in-\\nvolved in developing new products, additional opportunities are \\nnot expected to have a significant earnings impact on the \\nBMW Group. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to purchasing \\nThe greatest risk relating to purchasing comes from supply \\nshortages due to supplier bottlenecks. Production problems at \\nthe supplier level could lead to consequences caused by in-\\ncreased expenditure for the BMW Group due to production inter-\\nruptions and a corresponding reduction in vehicle sales. Supply \\nbottlenecks may also have a negative impact on the reputation \\nof the BMW Group if customer deman d cannot be met as \\nexpected.  \\nPotential reasons for the failure of suppliers to deliver include the \\nlack of availability of raw materials, energy and other input ma-\\nterials, the occurrence of natural hazards and/or fires, develop-\\nments in the security situation of a country, IT -related risks and \\nnon-compliance with sustainability or quality standards. The risk \\nis categorised as high. \\nDuring the selection of suppliers a standardised assessment of \\nrisk criteria is part of the sourcing process. \\nAn increasing complexity within the supplier network, particularly \\nwith sub-suppliers over which the BMW Group has only an indi-\\nrect influence, as well as a lack of solvency on the part of suppli-\\ners, may influence the delivery of supplies to plants. A prevention \\nprogramme was put in place in order to identify relevant devel-\\nopments early on and define individual measures. \\nAdditional risks arise from the inflation-related price increases of \\nrecent years and the resulting demands from suppliers, which \\ncan have a negative impact on earnings. In addition to price risks, \\nthe number of suppliers at risk of insolvency which the \\nBMW Group must support to maintain supplier operations is \\nincreasing. \\nThe rising threat of cyberattacks along the entire value chain af-\\nfects both the security of supply and the protection of expertise \\nrelevant to the BMW Group. In order to optimise the level of in-\\nformation security throughout the entire value and supply chain, \\nthe BMW  Group requires its suppliers to provide proof of ade-\\nquate information security certification. ↗ Purchasing and Supplier \\nNetwork \\nCost advantages gained by developing local supplier structures \\nnear BMW plants in addition to innovative manufacturing tech-\\nnologies could lead to lower material expenses for the \\nBMW Group. Opportunities arising as a result are classified as \\nimmaterial. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to the sales network \\nn order to sell its products and services, the BMW Group oper-\\nates a global sales network comprising subsidiaries, importers, \\nbranches and independent dealerships.

The threat level has continued to \\nrise over recent years. Increasing geopolitical conflicts also con-\\ntribute to the rise in cyberattacks. Moreover, legal and regulatory \\nrequirements are becoming ever stricter worldwide, which could \\nalso necessitate higher investments in hardware and software. \\nIn view of the higher incidence of observed attacks, the risk \\namount – despite extensive security measures – is still classified \\nas high. \\nIn order to protect vehicle functions from manipulation, we have \\nintroduced processes such as standardised safety assessments \\nand regular penetration tests. However, risks in this regard can \\nnever be fully ruled out due to the high complexity and increasing \\nconnectivity. \\nInformation and data can also be compromised by a lack of ris k \\nawareness and inappropriate behaviour. The main direct conse-\\nquences would be negative effects on Group revenues, disrup-\\ntion in production, or reputational damage. For this reason, the \\nBMW Group has launched an interactive programme to provide \\nregular training for every employee on the correct way to handle \\ndangerous emails. \\nProtecting information, for example from unauthorised access or \\nmisuse, has the highest priority. In conjunction with risk manage-\\nment requirements, risks relating to information security, data \\nprotection and IT are systematically documented, allocated ap-\\npropriate measures by the departments concerned and continu-\\nously monitored with regard to threat level and risk mitigation. \\nRegular analyses and controls as well as tight security manage-\\nment policies ensure an appropriate level of security. \\nHowever, despite continuous testing and preventive security \\nmeasures, it is impossible to completely eliminate risks in this \\narea. All authorised persons are required to treat information \\nsuch as confidential business, customer and employee data with \\ngreat care, use information systems securely and handle risks in \\na transparent manner. Uniform requirements that apply through-\\nout the Group are documented in a comprehensive set of rules \\nand guidelines. A consistently applied policy of updating such \\nrules and regulations to the current situation, coupled with regu-\\nlar communication, awareness-raising and training measures, \\nform the basis for a high level of security and risk awareness in \\ngeneral. \\nFinancial risks and risks relating to the use of financial \\ninstruments \\nCurrency risks and opportunities \\nAs an internationally operating enterprise, the BMW  Group con-\\nducts business in a variety of currencies, thus giving rise to cur-\\nrency risks and opportunities. A substantial portion of Group rev-\\nenues, production, other purchases and funding occur outside \\nthe eurozone.  \\nThe BMW  Group manages currency risks at both the strategic \\n(medium to long term) and operational level (short to medium \\nterm). Over the medium and long term, it is possible to ramp up \\nproduction or purchase volumes in foreign currency regions (nat-\\nural hedging). Currency risks are managed in the short to me-\\ndium term and for operational purposes by means of hedging on \\nfinancial markets, the primary objective of which is to improve \\nplanning reliability for the BMW Group as a whole. Regularly up-\\ndated cash-flow-at-risk models are used to limit currency risks \\nand identify opportunities. The risk amount associated with cur-\\nrency risks is classified as high. The strengthening of the euro in \\n2023 has led to an increased level of risk compared to the pre-\\nvious year. \\nDepending on exchange rate fluctuations, opportunities may \\nalso arise, which means they can be considered material. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices \\nAs a manufacturing company, the BMW Group is subject to price \\nrisks, particularly in relation to the raw materials used in vehicle \\nproduction. \\nThe analysis of raw materials price risks is based on planned pur-\\nchases of raw materials and components containing those prod-\\nucts. A cash-flow-at-risk model is deployed to measure risks re-\\nlating to raw materials prices. Price fluctuations for raw materials \\nsuch as precious metals, non -ferrous metals, raw materials for \\nbatteries and steel, and also energy, are hedged using financial \\nderivatives and supply contracts with fixed pricing arrangements. \\nThe prices of many raw materials continue to be subject to un-\\ncertainty on commodity markets. Accordingly, the risk amount \\nassociated with raw materials prices is classified as medium, but \\nthere are also material opportunities. This risk is lower than in the \\nprevious year due to the decline in prices of raw materials.  \\nLiquidity risks \\nThe major part of the Financial Services segment’s credit financ-\\ning and leasing business is refinanced on capital markets. The \\nrisk of restricted access to funds is deemed low. \\nThe liquidity concept, based on the experience gained during the \\nglobal financial crisis, is rigorously adhered to and continuously \\ndeveloped. In the Financial Services segment, the use of the \\n“matched funding principle” ensures that liquidity risks are gen-\\nerally avoided. \\nSolvency is assured at all times throughout  the BMW Group by \\nadhering to liquidity ratios and using a broadly diversified range \\nof refinancing sources. \\nThe liquidity position is monitored continuously and managed \\nthrough the Group-wide planning of financial requirements and \\nfunding. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial \\ninstruments is provided in ↗ Note [40] to the Group Financial State-\\nments. '),\n",

Counterparty risk denotes \\nthe risk that the BMW \\u202fGroup will not receive, or not receive in full, \\nthe payments due to it in connection with the investment and \\nhedging transactions referred to above. A value-at-risk model is \\nemployed to measure counterparty risk, taking into account the \\ncreditworthiness of the banks and the business volumes in-\\nvolved. Risk is managed using a limit system, which includes \\ndaily monitoring of the extent to which limits are being utilised at \\nthe level of the individual counterparties. \\nThe BMW Group holds equity investments of varying amounts in \\nnumerous entities. The recoverability of these investments is \\nmonitored on an ongoing basis as part of a standardised pro-\\ncess. However, risks from impairment losses could still arise. \\nThe risk associated with other financial risks is classified as me-\\ndium. Potential opportunities resulting from the revaluation of in-\\nvestments are evaluated as immaterial. \\nRisks and opportunities relating to pension obligations \\nFuture pension obligations are financed largely via external pen-\\nsion funds or trust constructs that are legally separate from the \\nBMW Group. Externally managed funds are invested on capital \\nmarkets in a broadly diversified portfolio with a view to enabling \\nfuture pension payments to be disbursed out of pension assets. \\nThese arrangements greatly reduce the need to fund pension \\npayments out of ongoing operations. Fluctuations in pension \\nprovisions and the related pension assets give rise to risks that \\nmay have varying effects due to the differences in accounting \\nstandards between IFRS and HGB. \\nThe risk associated with pension provisions based on IFRS val-\\nuations is categorised as medium. Material opportunities can \\narise if the value of pension assets on the capital markets devel-\\nops favourably or if pension provisions decreased at a more pro-\\nnounced rate than the related assets. \\nPension obligations are chiefly measured by projecting future \\npayouts, gauged with a current discount rate derived from mar-\\nket yields from top -rated corporate bonds. This discount rate is \\nsubject to market fluctuations and therefore influences the level \\nof pension obligations in terms of present value. Changes in \\nother parameters, such as inflation rates and life expectancy, \\nalso impact the amount as well as the duration of future pension \\npayments. Regulatory requirements may also affect the amount \\nof pension obligations. \\nThe fluctuation of pension assets reflects the volatility of various \\nasset classes on capital markets. Investments are broadly diver-\\nsified (interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other \\nasset classes). \\nReevaluations on the liabilities and assets sides are recognised \\nnet of deferred taxes through other comprehensive income and \\nhence directly in equity of the BMW  Group (within revenue re-\\nserves). Further information on risks in conjunction with pension \\nprovisions is provided in ↗ Note [33] to the Group Financial State-\\nments. \\nLegal risks \\nLike all entities with international operations, the BMW Group is \\nconfronted with legal disputes, alleged claims relating in particu-\\nlar to warranty and product liability or intellectual property rights \\ninfringements and proceedings initiated by government agen-\\ncies. Any of these could, amongst other conse quences, have an \\nadverse impact on the Group’s reputation. Such proceedings are \\ntypical for the sector, may result as a consequence of realigning \\nproduct or purchasing strategies to changed market conditions, \\nor are antitrust related. Particularly in the US market, class action \\nlawsuits and product liability risks can have substantial financial \\nconsequences and cause damage to the Group’s reputation. \\nMore rigorous application, interpretation of, or changes to, exist-\\ning regulations could result in a greater number of recalls.  \\nThe level of risk from legal risks is classified as medium. \\nThe potential financial impact of the matters covered under con-\\ntingent liabilities, including those related to legal and warranty \\nrisks, cannot be conclusively assessed at this stage. \\nInternational movements of goods require compliance with ex-\\ntensive export control regulations. In addition to goods-related \\nrestrictions, international trading may also involve personal, \\ncountry-specific and end -use-related restrictions. In particu lar, \\nnon-compliance with applicable EU and US export control regu-\\nlations could result in significant legal consequences for the \\nBMW Group. In light of its strong presence in the USA and China, \\nany intensification of the trade dispute between the two countries \\ncould be a potential source of additional risk exposure. \\nBMW Group companies are subject to governmental tax and \\ncustoms audits in each country where they operate, potentially \\nresulting in back taxes, retrospective customs duties, interest, \\npenalties and similar payments. Payments of this nature may, for \\ninstance, result from the non-recognition of inter-company trans-\\nfer prices in the countries concerned. Further substantial legal \\nrisks may emerge from contested interpretations of tax or cus-\\ntoms legislation. The findings of the tax audit in the countries are \\neffective for the audit period and, if applicable, in subsequent \\nyears. Risk management relating to tax and customs legislation \\nis enshrined in the BMW Group’s RMS. In order to minimise ma-\\nterial procedural tax and customs risks, the BMW  Group has set \\nup a comprehensive Tax Compliance Management System (Tax \\nCMS) that is already being applied in its major entities in Ger-\\nmany, China and, since the end of 2023, Austria, and will be \\nrolled out successively in other major countries. \\nThe BMW Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for \\nlawsuits and risks. In addition, a part of these risks is insured to \\nan economically reasonable extent. Nevertheless, it cannot be \\nruled out that damages may occur in excess of the insured \\namounts. In accordance with International Financial Reporting \\nStandards (IFRS), the required information is not provided if the \\nBMW Group concludes that disclosure of the information could \\nseriously prejudice the outcome of the relevan t legal proceed-\\nings. Further information on contingent liabilities is provided in \\n↗ Note [39] to the Group Financial Statements. '),\n",

Further-\\nmore, the credit portfolio is evaluated on an ongoing basis with \\nthe aim of determining if any impairment allowances need to be \\nmade for financial receivables. This evaluation is based on sta-\\ntistical methods and takes into account the following aspects, \\namong others: the creditworthiness of the customer, the cus-\\ntomer’s payment history and the economic context in the cus-\\ntomer’s region. The amount allocated to credit risks remains cat-\\negorised as medium. \\nThere may be positive effects in the ongoing assessment of the \\nportfolio’s creditworthiness that lead to a reduction of the overall \\nrisk and therefore constitute an opportunity. The BMW Group \\ncontinues to classify potential opportunities in this area as imma-\\nterial. In order to take account of the volatile economic environ-\\nment, parameters within the credit awarding process were re-\\nviewed and adjusted to factor in or not accept declining credit \\nratings. \\n \\n \\n \\nResidual value risks and opportunities \\nResidual value risks are classified as high in terms of their risk \\nlevel, while residual value opportunities are deemed significant. \\nThey arise primarily when leased vehicles are sold after they are \\nreturned at the end of the leasing period. A negative deviation \\nfrom the residual value forecast results in a residual value risk, \\nwhile a positive deviation represents a residual value oppor-\\ntunity. \\nEach lease contract is assigned a forecasted sales value for the \\nvehicle at the end of the lease term. Current market trends are \\ntaken into consideration within the routine portfolio evaluation. In \\naddition, the portfolio composition (e.g. by drivetrain type) is an-\\nalysed on an ongoing basis. Relevant changes and their impacts \\nare incorporated into the portfolio evaluation. The residual value \\ncalculation models, as well as the portfolio evaluation models, \\nare continually being refined. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nInterest rate risks \\nTo a limited degree, interest rate risks are deli berately accepted \\nin order to make use of the associated return potential. Risks \\nthereby result when there is a partial mismatch between fixed in-\\nterest rate periods, which means they are rated as low. The as-\\nsociated opportunities are classed as material. \\nOperational risks \\nOperational risks result from any form of ineffective or defective \\ninternal processes, systems, external events or human error. The \\naim is to systematically record and quantify all risks except for \\nthose listed in the paragraphs above. Because the risks arise in \\na wide range of areas of the Company, such as IT security or sup-\\nplier management, the close dovetailing of these areas is essen-\\ntial and ensures that there is adequate transparency regarding \\nthe current risk situation of the entire division.

For the medium-term period until 2035, we distin-\\nguish between transitory and physical climate risks. For the long-\\nterm period until 2050, the  evaluation focuses on the physical \\nclimate risks. \\nClimate scenarios \\nThe BMW Group uses three scenarios to identify and evaluate \\nclimate-related risks, which are based on the scenarios of the \\nShared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) of the Intergovernmen-\\ntal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \\nThese climate scenarios range from a low -emissions scenario \\nwith global warming of <+1.5 °C (Paris Agreement, SSP1- 2.6), \\na medium scenario with warming of an average of +2.5 °C (mid-\\ndle of the road, SSP2-4.5) to >+4 °C (fossil-fuelled development, \\nSSP5-8.5). \\nThe BMW Group has committed to aligning its business activities \\nwith the low-emissions scenario of the Paris Agreement and has \\nconsistently based its long -term corporate planning on this. \\n↗ Carbon Emissions \\nTransitory climate risks \\nTransitory climate risks arise from the transition to a low -emis-\\nsions economy across all sectors that is necessary in order to \\nmitigate climate change.

Potential impacts \\nare grouped into five different levels. \\nIn the Paris Agreement global warming scenario, the potential \\ntransitory risks are deemed the highest over the medium term as \\na result of the fast-paced, sometimes unforeseeable develop-\\nments. It cannot be ruled out that more decisive measures will \\nhave to be taken globally in the next few years in order to achieve \\nthe < +1.5°C target. For the BMW Group, this is reflected primar-\\nily in the risk dimensions of “Politics, legal affairs and regulatory \\nframework”, as well as “Market and competition”. Regulatory re-\\nquirements introduced at short notice may enter into force, which \\ncould have an impact on products, production and supply chains. \\nIn the “Market and competition” risk dimension, risks may also \\nincrease due to higher demand and the resulting higher prices for \\nselect (scarce) raw materials on the one hand and due to rising \\nenergy prices on the other. \\nTransitory climate risks \\n \\nPhysical climate risks \\nIn addition to the transitory risks, the BMW Group also evaluates \\nphysical risks. In doing so, the increasing frequency and intensity \\nof acute extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms \\nand floods, are taken into account, along with longer-term \\nchanges such as in terms of temperature and rainfall. \\nIn order to measure such risks, we draw on external data that \\nevaluate the development of acute and persistent natural phe-\\nnomena across the global warming scenarios and across time. \\nFor the BMW Group, this may result in damage to assets such as \\nbuildings, vehicles or parts on the one hand, and on the other \\nhand, such events may lead to downtime at BMW Group sites or \\nat suppliers’ sites. \\nPhysical climate risks also increase for the BMW Group particu-\\nlarly in the long-term >+4 °C scenario. This leads to a higher risk \\nboth for the BMW Group’s production sites and also for suppliers’ \\nsites.

Compliance means much more to \\nthe BMW Group than simply complying with applicable laws and \\nBMW Group directives around the globe. It forms part of our iden-\\ntity, our understanding of leadership and our living culture of in-\\ntegrity. Compliance creates a binding framework for all our busi-\\nness activities worldwide. \\nCompliance as a corporate function \\nCompliance is the managerial responsibility of the Board of Man-\\nagement of BMW AG, executed by creating an appropriate regu-\\nlatory and supervisory framework, as well as through regular and \\nad hoc reporting, accompanied by clear communications. This \\napproach is based on the core belief that compliance with applic-\\nable laws and related internal regulations is the responsibility of \\nall employees. As role models, managers are tasked with an-\\nchoring compliance culture in their area of responsibility and en-\\nsuring compliance requirements and processes are imple-\\nmented accordingly. ↗ GRI Index: 2-23 \\nIn addition to being responsible for the Company -wide Compli-\\nance Management System, the Chief Compliance Officer also \\nmanages the Group Compliance division and briefs the Board of \\nManagement and Supervisory Board of BMW  AG at regular  \\nintervals.\\nCompliance Management System (CMS) \\nThe BMW  Group’s Company -wide Compliance Management \\nSystem (CMS) reinforces the culture of compliance and integrity \\nand helps reduce sanction and liability risks, as well as risks aris-\\ning from other (non-)financial disadvantages, such as reputa-\\ntional risks. The CMS focuses on adequacy and effectiveness \\nand is based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond model, which de-\\nfines specific preventive, monitoring, control and response \\nmeasures. Clear assignment of roles and responsibilities is also \\nessential. \\nThe CMS is tailored to the BMW  Group’s risk situation and ad-\\ndresses all relevant compliance topics. Group -wide, these in-\\nclude anti corruption and fraud prevention, anti-money-launder-\\ning, antitrust and human rights compliance, export control com-\\npliance, data privacy protection and product compliance. In the \\nreporting year, the already established compliance programmes \\nExternal Workforce Compliance and Compliance for regulated Fi-\\nnancial Services Units were incorporated into the CMS. Respon-\\nsibility for Data Privacy Protection, Product Compliance, External \\nWorkforce Compliance and Compliance for Regulated Financial \\nServices Units outside Group Compliance lies with independent \\ndepartments. ↗ GRI Index: 2-27, 205-1, 205-3, 206-1 \\nFurther development of CMS \\nThe CMS is reviewed on a regular basis and refined as needed. \\nThis primarily involves evaluating strategic focus topics, legal \\nand regulatory requirements and trends, best practices as well \\nas industry standards, all of which are taken into account from a \\nrisk perspective. The objective is to consistently improve the \\nCMS. The BMW Group is an active member of various associa-\\ntions and interest groups, including the German Institute f or \\nCompliance e. V. (DICO), at Board level. \\nDuring the reporting period, a key area of focus was the updating \\nand further development of the compliance regulatory land-\\nscape. This included an update of the ↗ BMW Group Code of Conduct \\nas the central policy for the BMW Group’s expectations of its em-\\nployees in terms of compliance with applicable legal provisions \\nand internal regulations. An analysis of the BMW Group’s activi-\\nties to further improve antitrust compliance was also carried out. \\nFurther priority areas emerged in the context of export control, \\ndue to the war in Ukraine, and in anti -money-laundering efforts, \\ndue to the increase in legislative initiatives as well as in anticipa-\\ntion of changes to the business model aiming to intensify direct \\nsales. \\nOne component of the CMS is the compliance programme Data \\nPrivacy Protection, which is the responsibility of the department \\nGroup Data Privacy Protection. This is based on the directive Pri-\\nvacy Corporate Rules and the so-called Binding Corporate Rules, \\nwhich contractually protect the transfer of employee data within \\nthe BMW Group. Implementation of the programme is validated \\nthrough regular reporting by affiliated companies and independ-\\nent audits carried out by Group Data Privacy Protection. \\nThe Quality Management department is responsible for Product \\nCompliance as part of the CMS with a focus on preventing in-\\nfringements of product-related laws and official regulations as \\nwell as ensuring compliance with directly associated require-\\nments for products within the BMW Group’s Automotive and Mo-\\ntorcycles segments. During the reporting year, there was a ex-\\npansion of the Detect processes in particular, aimed at enhanc-\\ning preventive activities. This expansion was accompanied by \\nthe implementation of new training and communication formats. \\n \\nCOMPLIANCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS  '),\n",

In the reporting period, External Workforce \\nCompliance was restructured to ensure that the requirements for \\ncompliant contracts for work and labour are even more firmly \\nrooted in the procurement of services and cooperation with ser-\\nvice providers. \\nThe compliance programme Compliance for Regulated Financial \\nServices Units takes into account the particularities of the \\nfinancial services business and the risks and regulations in-\\nvolved. The specific focus of the programme – in addition to the \\nproper implementation of other compliance topics – is on legis-\\nlative and regulatory monitoring, consumer protection and the \\nimplementation of financial services supervisory requirements. \\n \\n \\nThree-Stage Approach of the Compliance Management System \\n \\nThe Financial Services segment has established its own dedi-\\ncated risk management unit, which works closely with the central \\nGroup Compliance function as part of the CMS.

Around 200 \\nmanagers Group-wide perform these tasks for their area of re-\\nsponsibility as operational Compliance Responsibles. \\nSpecialist departments worldwide are supported in their work by \\nthe central Group Compliance function, as well as the network of \\nbusiness unit and division Compliance Officers (heads of relevant \\ncompliance functions), supplemented by around 80 local Com-\\npliance Officers (heads of local compliance functions) at \\nBMW AG’s international subsidiaries. Every Compliance Officer \\nis tasked with implementing the CMS and compliance pro-\\ngrammes for defined topics in their area of activity, as well as \\nidentifying and realising division-specific compliance measures. \\nCompliance training \\nCompliance training opportunities are continuously refined for \\nspecific target groups. The online training courses with case \\nstudies and test que stions, repeated every two years, strength-\\nens the compliance culture and reinforces compliant behaviour. \\nMore than 95,500 staff and managers worldwide have so far \\ncompleted the Compliance Essentials training and 51,500 have \\nreceived the Antitrust Compliance training. This offering is sup-\\nplemented by target-group-specific classroom training on anti-\\ntrust compliance as well as online training courses on data pri-\\nvacy and product compliance. ↗ GRI Index: 205-2 \\nDigitalisation supports compliance \\nIT-based compliance systems are used for transparent and effi-\\ncient documentation, assessment and approval of compliance -\\nrelevant matters Group- wide. This includes topics such as \\nmoney laundering and sanctions lists, exchange activities with \\ncompetitors, business partner due diligence and verifying the le-\\ngal admissibility of benefits in kind. The data collected in this way \\nforms the basis for the compliance risk assessment. \\nCompliance and notification systems \\nEmployees with questions or concerns relating to compliance \\ncan discuss these matters with their managers or relevant de-\\npartments and, specifically, with the Compliance functions. The \\nCompliance contact serves as a further point of contact for both \\nemployees and external parties. \\nReports regarding potent ial compliance violations can also be \\nsubmitted anonymously and confidentially in several languages \\nvia the BMW Group SpeakUP Line notification system or via the \\nombudsperson. ↗ Checking effectiveness \\nThe BMW  Group protects information providers in two way s: \\nfirst, individuals may provide information without disclosing their \\nidentity; second, no one providing information faces retaliatory \\naction. All queries and concerns relating to compliance are doc-\\numented and processed using a Group-wide electronic case \\nmanagement system. If necessary, Corporate Audit, Corporate \\nSecurity, the legal departments or the Works Council may be \\nbrought in. ↗ GRI Index: 2-16 \\nCMS monitoring and controls \\nThe CMS provides differentiated monitoring levels for reviewing \\nobservance and implementation of compliance rules and pro-\\ncesses at regular intervals. In addition to the direct checks per-\\nformed by Compliance Responsibles as business managers, \\nrisks are further reduced by additional measures integrated into \\nbusiness processes, which generally form part of the ↗ Internal \\nControl System. \\nCompliance investigations are carried out when the need arises \\nor ad hoc as part of the Detect function of central Group Compli-\\nance. These include internal investigations in connection with of-\\nficial investigations, which serve to clarify the facts internally. \\nRisk-based compliance audits aimed at identifying specific com-\\npliance risks are focused on antitrust law. In 2023, export control \\nand anti -money-laundering efforts were incorporated as new \\ntopics. Corporate Audit also monitors adherence to compliance \\nrequirements by business managers, as well as selected  ele-\\nments of the CMS. \\nAll control checks are geared towards reducing compliance risks. \\nAny infringements are immediately remedied, with an emphasis \\non reducing the risk of repeat offences as far as possible. Where \\ninfringements can be traced to an individual, that person will be \\nappropriately sanctioned, in accordance with the processes de-\\nfined for this purpose. \\nAs part of the annual review of the BMW  Group CMS, its appro-\\npriateness and effectiveness are assessed on the basis of de-\\nfined criteria. In addition to the assessment of the Compliance \\nResp\\nonsibles, the measurement also takes into account the as-\\nsessment of compliance and other governance functions .

Our ↗ Group-wide approach,  which is subject to continuous \\nimprovement, is based on established due diligence processes \\nthat encompass our own business operations, our ↗ supply chains \\nas well as other business partners. The individual steps include \\na risk analysis, prevention, control and mitigation measures, \\n↗ Complaint mechanisms, review of effectiveness and reporting. \\nThe focus is on topics where the BMW Group has identified high \\nrisks in terms of human rights and environmental aspects and \\nwhere it has a certain level of influence. We place particular em-\\nphasis on our global, extensive and highly complex supply chain. \\nWe offer comprehensive details about the multistage due dili-\\ngence process for upholding human rights within the supplier \\nnetwork in the section ↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network. \\nInternationally recognised guidelines for the protection of human \\nrights set the benchmark for the BMW Group’s entire value chain. \\nWe regard them as specific demands placed on ourselves, our \\nsupply chain and other business partners. They are closely inter-\\nlinked with the ↗ Human rights compliance programme and the \\n↗ BMW Group Code of Conduct and anchored in the following specific \\nCompany-wide policies: \\n― ↗ Joint Declaration on Human Rights and Working Conditions:  \\nCommitment to value -driven corporate governance, \\nformulated in collaboration with employ ee representatives \\nand the trade union. \\n― ↗ BMW Group Code on Human Rights and Working Conditions:  \\nGuidance for employees, suppliers and authorised sales \\npartners regarding the BMW Group’s efforts to safeguard \\nhuman rights and ensure fair working conditions. \\n― ↗ Declaration of Principles on Respect for Human Rights and Related \\nEnvironmental Standards:  Approach and processes regarding \\nthe implementation of the German Supply Chain Due \\nDiligence Act (LkSG). \\n― ↗ BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct:  The BMW  Group’s \\nrequirements and expectations for its global supplier \\nnetwork in accordance with internationally recognised \\nsustainability standards and guidelines. \\nThe BMW Group has established clear responsibilities across the \\norganization for implementing and monitoring due diligence ob-\\nligations. Within the BMW Group, responsibility rests with the re-\\nspective departments and the management of the Group enti-\\nties, while outside the BMW Group it lies with the relevant busi-\\nness partners and suppliers. Central functions such as Group \\nCompliance and Sustainability in the Supply Chain oversee and \\nmonitor compliance with due diligence obligations in the relevant \\narea. The BMW Group Human Rights Officer, who was ap-\\npointed by the Board of Management of BMW  AG at the end of \\n2021 as one of the requirements of the LkSG, also assumes a \\nsupport and monitoring function. \\nIn the reporting period, we focused on further developing the ex-\\nisting due diligence processes following the first-time application \\nof the LkSG. In addition to the policy statement published at the \\nend of 2022, this includes the further development of the risk \\nanalysis for our own business operations. In 2023, we have also \\nupdated the Human Rights Code and integrated the topic of hu-\\nman rights into the ↗ BMW Group Code of Conduct. \\n↗ GRI Index: 2-23, 2-24 '),\n",

The ICS \\nfor non-financial reporting focuses primarily on the further devel-\\nopment of the processes used to gather data as the basis for re-\\nporting the non-financial performance indicators disclosed in the \\nBMW Group Report. \\nThe ICS is based on the “three lines” model, including a clear def-\\ninition of how the various functions are required to interact with \\none another in order to manage risks. As a component of the \\nsecond line, the ICS serves as the link between the operating \\nunits (first line) and Corporate Audit (third line). \\nIn principle, the ai m of every appropriate and effective ICS is to \\nprevent potential risks in external financial and non -financial re-\\nporting or reduce the likelihood of potential risks materialising. \\nInternationally acknowledged standards for internal control sys-\\ntems were taken into account when designing the various ele-\\nments of the ICS deployed by the BMW  Group (e.g. COSO \\nmodel2). \\nThe principal features of the BMW Group’s ICS are a role-based \\napproach embedded throughout the organisation, a clearly de-\\nfined control environment that is underpinned by a combination \\nof risk assessment procedures, control activities, information and \\ncommunication, and monitoring activities. \\nBoth the system itself and the methods applied are subject to \\ncontinuous improvement, with its functionality being assessed \\non a regular basis. Notwithstanding the measures taken, every \\ncontrol system is subject to inherent limitations, given that it is \\nnot possible to prevent all incorrect disclosures or detect them in \\na timely manner. \\nRelevant BMW  Group workin g instructions and guidelines for \\nrecognising, measuring and allocating items to accounts as well \\nas definitions of non-financial performance indicators are avail -\\nable to all employees via the BMW Group’s intranet system. New \\nreporting standards are assess ed for their potential impact on \\nthe BMW Group’s reporting. \\nThe principle of segregation of duties is taken into account for all \\nIT systems that are relevant for accounting and financial report-\\ning. ICS requirements are also embedded in the ongoing devel-\\nopment of all IT systems used in these areas. Furthermore, the \\nBMW Group deploys data analysis tools to identify and subse-\\nquently eliminate any weaknesses detected in its processes \\nand/or control systems. \\nResponsibilities for ensuring the appropriateness and  effective-\\nness of ICS procedures for accounting and financial reporting \\nprocesses as well as those relating to non-financial performance \\nindicators are clearly defined in a role-based model and allocated \\nto the relevant line and process managers. They report annually \\non their assessment of the ICS for accounting and financial re-\\nporting processes and the processes for non-financial perfor-\\nmance indicators. The assessment takes into account the results \\nof internal and external audits as well as the results of continuous \\nmonitoring. The results of the assessment are gathered and doc-\\numented in a centralised IT system. Both the Board of Manage-\\nment and the Audit Committee are informed about the status of \\nthe ICS on an annual basis.

Pursuant to §  325 HGB, the Group Finan-\\ncial Statements and the Group Management Report are required \\nto be submitted electronically to the operator of the German \\nCompany Register and made accessible via that agency’s web-\\nsite. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG), \\nwhich has its seat in Germany, Munich, Petuelring 130, is regis-\\ntered in the Commercial Register of the District Court of Munich \\nunder the number HRB 42243. BMW AG manufactures automo-\\nbiles and motorcycles in the premium segment. \\nThe Group Financial Statements have been drawn up in euro s. \\nAll amounts are disclosed in millions of euros (€ million) unless \\nstated otherwise. \\nKey figures presented in this report have been rounded in ac-\\ncordance with standard commercial practise. In certain cases, \\nthis may mean that values do not add up exactly to the stated \\ntotal and that percentages cannot be derived from the values \\nshown. \\nThe income statement for the BMW Group and segments is pre-\\nsented using the cost of sales method.  \\n \\n \\n \\nIn order to provide a better insight into the results of operations, \\nfinancial position and net assets of the BMW Group, and going \\nbeyond the requirements of IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the \\nGroup Financial Statements also include an income statement \\nand a balance sheet for the Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial \\nServices and Other Entities segments. The Group Cash Flow \\nStatement is supplemented by a statement of cash flows for the \\nAutomotive and Financial Services segments. Inter-segment \\ntransactions relate primarily to internal sales of products, the pro-\\nvision of funds for Group companies and the related interest. A \\ndescription of the nature of the business and the major operating \\nactivities of the BMW Group’s segments is provided in ↗ note 46 \\n(Explanatory notes to segment information). \\nApproval for the publication of the Group Financial Statements \\nwas granted by the Board of Management on 12 March 2024. \\n02 Group reporting entity and consolidation principles \\nThe BMW Group Financial Statements include BMW AG and all \\nmaterial subsidiaries over which BMW AG – either directly or in-\\ndirectly – exercises control. This also includes 62 structured en-\\ntities, consisting of asset -backed financing arrangements and \\nspecial purpose funds. In some cases, contractual agreements \\nare in place with the asset-backed securities companies to offset \\ntheir losses in connection with residual value risks arising from \\nthe receivables sold to them. \\n \\n \\n \\nIn relation to fully consolidated companies, the following changes \\ntook place in the Group reporting entity in the financial year \\n2023: \\n  Germany  Foreign  Total \\nIncluded at 31 December 2022   20  184  204 \\nIncluded for the first time in 2023   –  18  18 \\nNo longer included in 2023  –  15  15 \\nIncluded at 31 December 2023   20  187  207 \\n    \\nAll consolidated subsidiaries have the same year -end as BMW \\nAG with the exception of BMW India Private Ltd. and BMW India \\nFinancial Services Private Ltd., whose year-ends are 31 March \\nin accordance with local legal requirements. Interim financial \\nstatements are prepared as at 31 December for the two compa-\\nnies with divergent reporting dates. \\nWhen assessing whether an investment gives rise to a controlled \\nentity, an associated company, a joint operation or a joint ven-\\nture, the BMW Group considers contractual arrangements and \\nother circumstances, as well as the structure and legal form of \\nthe entity. Discretionary decisions may also be required. If indi-\\ncations exist of a change in the judgement of (joint) control, the \\nBMW Group undertakes a new assessment. \\nNOTES  TO  THE  GROUP  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/raw/reports/bmw_2023.pdf', 'page': 160}, page_content='161 BMW Group Report 2023  To Our Stakeholders  Combined Management Report  Group Financial Statements  Responsibility Statement and Auditor’s Report  Remuneration Report  Other Information               \\n       Notes to the Group Financial Statements       \\n \\n \\nAn entity is deemed to be controlled if BMW AG – either directly \\nor indirectly – has power over it, is exposed or has rights to vari-\\nable returns from it and has the ability to influence those returns. \\nAn entity is classified as an associated company if BMW  AG – \\neither directly or indirectly – has the ability to exercise significant \\ninfluence over the entity’s operating and financial policies. As a \\ngeneral rule, the Group is assumed to have significant influence \\nif it holds 20% or more of the entity’s voting power. \\nJoint operations and joint ventures are forms of joint arrange-\\nments. Such an arrangement exists when a BMW Group entity \\njointly carries out activities with a third party on the basis of a \\ncontractual agreement. \\nIn the case of a joint operation, the parties that have joint control \\nof the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for \\nthe liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Assets, liabilities, rev-\\nenues and expenses of a joint operation are recognised propor-\\ntionately in the Group Financial Statements on the basis of the \\nBMW Group entity’s rights and obligations (proportionate con-\\nsolidation). The impact of joint operations on the Group Financial \\nStatements is of minor significance. \\nThe BMW Group’s largest joint operation is Spotlight Automotive \\nLimited (Spotlight), which has been operated together with the \\nChinese automobile manufacturer Great Wall Motor Company \\nLimited (Great Wall) since 2019, jointly developing and manu-\\nfacturing electric vehicles for the MINI and Great Wall brands in \\nChina. The BMW Group and Great Wall each hold 50% of the \\njoint operation’s equity. \\nIn the case of a joint venture, the parties which have joint control \\nonly have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. \\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are accou nted for us-\\ning the equity method, with measurement on initial recognition \\nbased on acquisition cost. \\nOn 11 February 2022, via its subsidiary BMW Holding B.V., the \\nBMW Group increased its shareholding in the BMW Brilliance Au-\\ntomotive Ltd. (BMW Brilliance) joint venture from 50% to 75% \\nwith the acquisition of a further 25% of BMW Brilliance’s shares. \\nBMW Brilliance has been fully consolidated in the Group Finan-\\ncial Statements since that date. With regard to the figures re-\\nported for the previous financial year, it should therefore be noted \\nthat BMW Brilliance is only included for the relevant part of 2022 \\n(i.e. from 11 February onwards). If BMW Brilliance had been fully \\nincluded in the Group Financial Statements with effect from 1 \\nJanuary 2022, Group revenues and profit after tax for the finan-\\ncial year 2022 would have amounted to €  145,521 million and \\n€ 18,842 million respectively. The remeasurement of the previ-\\nously held shares resulted in a gain of €  7,649 million on first -\\ntime consolidation, which was recognised in income from invest-\\nments within the line item “Other financial result” in the previous \\nyear. Detailed information is provided in ↗ BMW Group Report 2022, \\nnote [3] to the Group Financial Statements. \\nOn 19 July 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement with the \\ncompanies of the Mercedes -Benz Group AG, the Stellantis \\nGroup, the Honda Group, the Hyundai Motor Group and the Gen-\\neral Motors Company Group to establish a company in Canada \\nwith the aim of developing charging infrastructure in North Amer-\\nica. Following approval by the relevant antitrust authorities, the \\ntransaction was completed on 18 October 2023, with the BMW \\nGroup holding a 16.67% stake. Although this is below 20%, the \\nnewly founded entity is included in the BMW Group Financial \\nStatements as an associated company using the equity method, \\nreflecting the fact that the BMW Group is represented on the \\nmanagement board and therefore has significant influence. \\nOn 6 November 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement \\nwith the Mercedes-Benz Group AG to esta blish a company in \\nChina with the aim of developing a charging infrastructure there. \\nApproval has been granted by the antitrust authorities. The BMW \\nGroup will hold a 50% stake in the newly founded entity. It will \\nbe included in the BMW Group Financial Sta tements as a joint \\nventure using the equity method. \\nOn 30 September 2021, the BMW Group signed an agreement \\nwith the Huachen Group to acquire all of the shares of Brilliance \\nAutomobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd., a Huachen Group subsidi-\\nary. The transaction will not, however, be completed.  \\nThe other changes to the Group reporting entity do not have a \\nmaterial impact on the results of operations, financial position \\nand net assets of the Group. \\n03 Other significant events \\nRussia-Ukraine war \\nMajor uncertainties rem ained at 31 December 2023 with re-\\nspect to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The current sanctions \\nand the countermeasures taken significantly restrict economic \\nactivities with Russia and also have an impact on the Russian \\ncompanies of the BMW Group. \\nThe restrictions currently in place for payments continue to re-\\nstrict the transfer of liquid funds from Russia. Developments in \\nthis area are reviewed by the BMW Group on a regular basis. In \\ntotal, the Russian companies hold around 4% (2022: 5%) of the \\nBMW Group’s cash and cash equivalents. \\nA closing rate of RUB 100.62 (2022: 77.12) to the euro was ap-\\nplied at 31 December 2023 to translate foreign currency items \\ndenominated in Russian roubles. The BMW Group has been able \\nto execute transactions at this rate. '),\n",

Under this method, assets and liabilities are \\ntranslated at the closing exchange rate, while income and ex-\\npenses are translated at the average exchange rate. Differences \\narising on foreign currency translation are presented in “Accu-\\nmulated other equity”. In the single entity accounts of BMW AG \\nand its subsidiaries, for eign currency receivables and payables \\nare measured on initial recognition using the exchange rate pre-\\nvailing at the date of first-time recognition. Advance payments to \\nsuppliers or from customers in a foreign currency that result in \\nthe addition of non-monetary assets or liabilities are recorded at \\nthe exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment. At the end \\nof the reporting period, foreign currency receivables and pay-\\nables are measured using the closing exchange rate. The result-\\ning unrealised gains and losses, as well as realised gains and \\nlosses arising on settlement, are recognised in the income state-\\nment, in line with the underlying substance of the transaction. \\nNon-monetary balance sheet line items denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies are rolled forward on the basis of historical exchange \\nrates. \\nThe exchange rates of currencies which have a material impact \\non the Group Financial Statements were as follows: \\n  Closing rate  Average rate \\n         \\n1 euro =  31.12.2023  31.12.2022  2023  2022 \\nUS dollar  1.11  1.07  1.08  1.05 \\nChinese renminbi  7.86  7.36  7.66  7.08 \\nBritish pound  0.87  0.89  0.87  0.85 \\nJapanese yen  156.58  141.11  151.98  138.02 \\nSouth Korean won  1,435.44  1,346.97  1,412.98  1,357.16 \\n    \\nArgentina has fulfilled the definition of a hyperinflationary econ-\\nomy since 1 July 2018. Since that date, IAS 29 (Financial Re-\\nporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) has therefore been ap-\\nplied for the BMW subsidiary in Argentina. The price indices pub-\\nlished by the Federación Argentina de Consejos Profesionales de \\nCiencias Económicas (FACPCE) are used to adjust non -mone-\\ntary asset, liability and income statement line items. The result-\\ning effects are not material for the BMW Group. \\n  '),\n",

In a Group-wide project, the \\nBMW Group examined the impact of adopting IFRS 17 for exist-\\ning agreements. The BMW Group offers various products that \\nmeet the definition of an insurance contract in accordance with \\nIFRS 17. However, for the majority of these products, either an \\nexemption applies (e.g. for warranty agreements) or the insur-\\nance arrangements qualify as fixed-fee service contracts, which \\ncan continue to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15 due \\nto the option available in IFRS 17. In some markets, however, \\nproducts are offered (e.g. comprehensive vehicle insurance) that \\nare required to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 17. \\nThese contracts can be accounted for using the premium alloca-\\ntion approach, which is essentially the same as the accounting \\nmethod already being applied for such contracts. In the financial \\nyear 2023, insurance premiums for insurance contracts amount-\\ning to € 89 million were recognised in other income within the \\nline item “Revenues”. At 31 December 2023, insurance liabilities \\nfor the remaining terms of these contracts amounted to €  289 \\nmillion. \\nIn May 2023, the IASB published International Tax Reform – Pil-\\nlar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12) which sets out a \\nmandatory exemption to the accounting for deferred taxes in \\nconjunction with the global minimum taxation (Pillar Two). The \\namendments provide for a temporary exemption from recognis-\\ning deferred taxes resulting from the implementation of the Pillar \\nTwo rules. The exemption has accordingly been applied by the \\nBMW Group. The amendments also include disclosures in the \\nnotes to explain the impact of the introduction of minimum taxa-\\ntion on affected entities. The introduction of the Pillar Two regu-\\nlations is not expected to have any significant impact on the \\nBMW Group Financial Statements.  \\nb Financial reporting pronouncements issued by the IASB, but not \\nyet applied \\nOther financial reporting standards and revised standards issued \\nby the IASB that have not yet been applied are not expected to \\nhave any significant impact on the BMW Group Financial State-\\nments. \\nc Accounting policy changes in the financial year 2023 \\nIn order to increase consistency between internal performance \\nmanagement and external reporting, the following accounting \\npolicies were changed in the financial year 2023.  \\nGovernment grants related to assets were previously reported as \\ndeferred income and recognised through profit or loss over the \\naccounting periods in which the costs occur that they are in-\\ntended to compensate. With effect from the financial year 2023, \\ngovernment grants relating to assets are deducted from the car-\\nrying amount of the relevant assets and therefore now recog-\\nnised in profit or loss over the respective useful lives of the assets\\nin the form of reduced depreciation/amortisation. In this context, \\nthe accounting treatment applied for investment tax credits was \\nalso changed. Instead of being recognised immediately as a re-\\nduction of income tax expense, with effect from the financial year \\n2023 investment tax credits are also deducted from the carrying \\namount of the related assets. The income statement impact is \\ntherefore also spread over the respective useful lives of the as-\\nsets in the form of lower depreciation/amortisation expense. The \\nchange in accounting policy has not been applied retrospectively \\non the grounds of immateriality. Prior-year figures have therefore \\nnot been adjusted.  \\nDeferred income for government grants relating to assets at 31 \\nDecember 2022 amounted to € 465 million or 0.19% of Group \\ntotal assets at that date. At 31 December 2023, the correspond-\\ning amount was € 370 million.  \\nAlso with a view to increasing consistency with internal perfor-\\nmance management, with effect from the financial year 2023 \\nadvance payments to suppliers are reported within other assets. \\nAt 31 December 2022, advance payments to suppliers amount-\\ning to € 259 million were reported within inventories. Prior year \\nfigures have not been adjusted on the grounds of immateriality. \\nThe impact of the changes in accounting policy is not material for \\nthe results of operations, financial position and net assets of the \\nBMW Group.

As a matter of principle, the Group Financial State-\\nments are prepared in accordance with the BMW Group ’s long-\\nterm corporate plan, as approved by management, taking into \\naccount issues relevant for climate change such as the transfor-\\nmation to electric mobility, regulatory requirements and changes \\nin production conditions. In this context, the BMW Group incurs \\nexpenditure on research and development for electrified models, \\ninvests in resource-saving production facilities for the manufac-\\nture of electrified automobiles and, in particular, is gradually con-\\nverting its production processes from fossil fuels to green energy \\nby concluding long -term power purchase agreements for elec-\\ntricity and gas from renewable sources. \\nAs a consequence of joining the Business Ambition for 1.5°C \\ncampaign led by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), the \\nBMW Group pursues validated SBTi Near Term Targets for the \\nyear 2030, which are incorporated in the Group’s long-term cor-\\nporate plan. \\nThe targets set include a reduction in average carbon emissions \\nof 80% per vehicle produced in our own plants and locations \\n(Scope 1 and Scope 2), an average reduction of more than 50% \\nper kilometre driven in the use phase (Scope 3 downstream) and \\nan average reduction of more than 20% per vehicle in the supply \\nchain (Scope 3 upstream). \\nIn line with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate -\\nrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), both physical and transi-\\ntion-related risks and opportunities are taken into account in the \\nGroup’s internal performance management system and in con-\\njunction with the preparation of the Group Financial Statements. \\nThese aspects, referred to below as “climate- related aspects”, \\nare highly relevant for the preparation of the Group Financial  \\nStatements, particularly in the case of assumptions, judgements \\nand estimations relating to future developments that impact the \\nBMW Group and its environment, and are therefore included in \\ntheir assessment. \\nMore detailed information on how climate -related aspects are \\ntaken into account for recognition and measurement purposes is \\nprovided below, particularly in the comments on property, plant \\nand equipment, leased products and the performance of impair-\\nment tests. This includes an indication of the extent to which cli-\\nmate-related aspects have been taken into account in the est i-\\nmations and assumptions for the recognition and measurement \\nof balance sheet items. \\nRevenues from customer contracts include in particular reve-\\nnues from the sale of products (primarily new and pre-owned ve-\\nhicles and related products) as well as revenues from services. \\nRevenue is recognised when control is transferred to the dealer-\\nship or retail customer. In the case of sales of products, this is \\nusually at the point in time when the risks and rewards of owner-\\nship are transferred. Revenues are stated net of settlement dis-\\ncount, bonuses and rebates as well as interest and residual value \\nsubsidies. The consideration arising from these sales usually \\nfalls due for payment immediately or within 30 days. In excep-\\ntional cases, a longer payment may also be agreed. In the case \\nof services, control is transferred over time. Consideration for the \\nrendering of services to customers usually falls due for payment \\nat the beginning of a contract and is therefore deferred as a con-\\ntract liability. The deferred amount is released over the service \\nperiod and recognised as revenue in the income statement. As a \\nrule, amounts are released on the basis of the expected expense \\ntrend, as this best reflects the performance of the service. If the \\nsale of products includes a determinable amount for services \\n(multiple-component contracts), the related revenues are de-\\nferred and recognised as income in the same way. Variable con-\\nsideration components, such as bonuses, are measured at the \\nexpected value, and in the case of multi -component contracts, \\nallocated to all performance obligations unless directly attribut -\\nable to the sale of a vehicle.  \\nRevenues from the sale of products, for which repurchase ar-\\nrangements are in place, are not recognised immediately in full. \\nInstead, revenues are either recognised proportionately or the \\ndifference between the sales and repurchase price is recognised \\nin instalments over the term of the contract depending on the na-\\nture of the agreement. In the case of vehicles sold to a dealership \\nthat are expected to be repurchased in a subsequent period as \\npart of leasing operations, revenues are not recognised at Group \\nlevel at the time of the sale of the vehicle. Instead, assets and \\nliabilities relating based on the right of return of these vehicles \\nare recognised. \\nRevenues from leases of own-manufactured vehicles are recog-\\nnised at Group level in accordance with the requirements for \\nmanufacturer or dealer leases. In the case of operating leases, \\nrevenues from lease payments are recognised on a straight-line \\nbasis over the lease term. Finance leases, on the other hand, are \\naccounted for as a sale. At the lease commencement date, rev-\\nenues are recognised at the amount of the fair value of the leased \\nasset and reduced by any unguaranteed residual value of vehi-\\ncles that are expected to be returned to the Group at the end of \\nthe lease term. In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as \\ncost of sales at the lease commencement date. \\nRevenues also include interest income from financial services.

The resulting income \\nis recognised in cost of sales over the periods in which the costs \\noccur that they are intended to compensate. Information on the \\naccounting policy changes applied for the first time from the fi-\\nnancial year 2023 relating to government grants received for as-\\nsets as well as to investment tax credits is provided in ↗ note 5. \\nEarnings per share are calculated as follows: basic earnings per \\nshare are calculated for common and preferred stock by dividing \\nthe net profit for the year (after non-controlling interests) that is \\nattributable to each category of stock, by the average number of \\nshares of each category in circulation. Net profit for the year is \\naccordingly allocated to the different categories of stock. The \\nportion of the net profit that is not being distributed is allocated \\nto each category of stock based on the number of outstanding \\nshares. Profits available for distribution are determined directly \\non the basis of the dividend proposals or resolutions for common \\nand preferred stock. Diluted earnings per share are calculated \\nand separately disclosed in accordance with IAS 33. \\nIntangible assets are measured on initial recognition at acquisi-\\ntion or manufacturing cost. Subsequently, intangible assets with \\nfinite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their \\nuseful lives of between three and 20 years. Impairment losses \\nare recognised where necessary. Intangible assets with indefi-\\nnite useful lives are tested annually for impairment. Internally \\ngenerated intangible assets mainly comprise development costs \\nfor vehicle, module and architecture projects. \\nDevelopment costs are capitalised if all of the criteria specified \\nby IAS  38 are met. They are measured on the basis of direct \\ncosts and directly attributable overhead costs. Project -related \\ncapitalised development costs are amortised on a straight -line \\nbasis following the start of production over the estimated product \\nlife (usually five to 12 years). \\nGoodwill arises when the cost of acquiring a business exceeds \\nthe Group’s share of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and \\ncontingent liabilities identified during the acquisition. \\nIntangible assets also include emission allowances and similar \\nrights arising from programmes aimed at reducing carbon or \\nother climate-damaging emissions (for example in conjunction \\nwith the EU Emissions Trading System or vehicle -related emis-\\nsions regulations in the USA or China). These allowances and \\nrights are carried at cost and, in the event that they are allocated \\nfree of charge, recorded at a value of zero. Amounts are derec-\\nognised when they are returned or, in exceptional cases, when \\nthey are sold or expire. In parallel to the recognition of these al-\\nlowances and rights as assets, provisions are recognised in ac-\\ncordance with IAS 37 corresponding to the amount of obligations \\nexpected to arise in conjunction with the related emissions regu-\\nlations. Provisions are measured on the basis of the expected \\nvalue of the allowances or rights that are to be returned. \\nIf there is any indication of impairment of intangible assets, or \\nif an annual impairment test is required (i.e. intangible assets \\nwith an indefinite useful life, intangible assets during the devel-\\nopment phase and goodwill), an impairment test is performed. \\nEach individual asset is tested separately unless the cash flows \\ngenerated by the asset are not sufficiently independent from the \\ncash flows generated by other assets or other groups of assets. \\nIn these cases, impairment is tested at the level of a cash-gener-\\nating unit, which is the norm for the BMW Group. \\nFor the purpose of  the impairment test, the carrying amount of \\nan asset (or a cash-generating unit) is compared with the recov-\\nerable amount. The first step of the impairment test is to deter-\\nmine the value in use. If the value in use is lower than the carrying \\namount, the next step is to determine the fair value less costs to \\nsell and compare the amount so determined with the asset’s car-\\nrying amount. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount, \\nan impairment loss is recognised, reducing the carrying amount \\nto the higher of the asset’s value in use or fair value less costs to \\nsell. \\nIf the reason for a previously recognised impairment loss no \\nlonger exists, the impairment loss is reversed up to the level of \\nthe recoverable amount, but no higher than the amortised acqui-\\nsition or manufacturing cost. Impairment losses on goodwill are \\nnot reversed. As part of the process of assessing recoverability, \\nit is generally necessary to apply estimations and assumptions – \\nin particular regarding future cash inflows and outflows and th e \\nlength of the forecast period – which could differ from actual \\namounts. Actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and \\nestimations used if business conditions develop differently to  \\nexpectations. \\nThe BMW Group determines the value in use of intangible assets \\non the basis of a present value computation. The cash flows used \\nfor this calculation are derived from the long-term corporate plan \\napproved by management, corresponding to a forecast period of \\nsix years. '),\n",

Forecasting assumptions are adjusted \\nto current information and regularly compared with external \\nsources. The assumptions used take account in particular of ex-\\npectations of the profitability of the product portfolio, future mar-\\nket share development, macroeconomic developments (such as \\ncurrency, interest rate and raw materials prices) as well as the \\nlegal environment and past experience. \\nAssumptions also take into account the impact of climate-related \\naspects and the influence of other sustainability factors on busi-\\nness performance and the product portfolio, for example as a re-\\nsult of changes in demand patterns, regulatory requirements or \\nchanges in production conditions. In line with the BMW Group’s \\nstrategy process and the ongoing transformation to electric mo-\\nbility, the detailed forecast takes account of key assumptions \\nsuch as the planned increase in the share of electrified automo-\\nbiles to over 50% and the required level of expenditure on re-\\nsearch and development for vehicle models with battery-electric \\ndrives. Other matters to be considered are the scale of future in-\\nvestments in resource-saving production facilities (including any \\nexpected efficiency improvements), the cost of converting pro-\\nduction processes from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources \\nand, last but not least, the expected impact on the current leasing \\nportfolio.  \\nAmounts are discounted on the basis of a market-related cost of \\ncapital rate. Impairment tests are performed for accounting and \\nfinancial reporting purposes and using a risk -adjusted pre -tax \\ncost of capital (WACC) for the Automotive (excluding BMW Bril-\\nliance), BMW Brilliance and Motorcycles cash-generating units. \\nIn the case of the Financial Services cash-generating unit, a pre-\\ntax cost of equity capital is used, as is customary in the sector. \\nBy analogous application of the procedures used for the other \\ncash-generating units, the value in use is also determined for the \\nBMW Brilliance cash-generating unit in view of the time period \\nsince the acquisition date. \\nThe following pre-tax discount factors were applied: \\nin %  2023  2022 \\nAutomotive excluding BMW Brilliance   13.7  12.4 \\nBMW Brilliance  15.6  15.4 \\nMotorcycles  13.7  12.4 \\nFinancial Services  15.2  13.7 \\n    \\nThe risk-adjusted discount rate, calculated using a capital asset \\npricing model (CAPM), also takes into account  specific peer -\\ngroup information relating to beta-factors, capital structure data \\nand borrowing costs. No environmental, social and governance \\n(ESG)-related adjustments were made to the WACC. \\nIn conjunction with the impairment tests for cash- generating \\nunits, sensitivity analyses are performed for the main assump-\\ntions in order to rule out that possible changes to the assump-\\ntions used to determine the recoverable amount would result in \\nthe requirement to recognise an impairment loss. Even in the \\ncase of a 10% deterioration in the individual measurement as-\\nsumptions, an impairment loss would not arise. If the WACC were \\nto develop as in the previous year, the value in use calculated for \\nthe Financial Services cash-generating unit would fall slightly be-\\nlow its carrying amount in 2024. The BMW Group does not, how-\\never, expect the WACC to develop as in the previous year. \\nAll items of property, plant and equipment are measured at ac-\\nquisition or manufacturing cost less accumulated depreciation \\nand accumulated impairment losses. \\nThe cost of internally constructed plant and equipment com-\\nprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manufactur-\\ning process as well as an appropriate proportion of production-\\nrelated overheads. This includes production-related depreciation \\nand amortisation as well as an appropriate proportion of admin-\\nistrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in ac-\\nquisition or manufacturing cost unless they are directly attribut-\\nable to the asset. The carrying amount of items of depreciable  \\nproperty, plant and equipment is written down according to \\nscheduled usage-based depreciation – as a general rule on a \\nstraight-line basis – over the useful lives of the assets. Depreci-\\nation is recorded as an expense in the income statement. \\nThe following us eful lives are applied throughout the BMW \\nGroup: \\nin years   \\nFactory and office buildings, residential buildings, fixed \\ninstallations in buildings and outside facilities   8 to 50 \\nPlant and machinery  3 to 30 \\nOther facilities, factory and office equipment  2 to 25 \\n    \\nThe useful life of the plant and equipment is reviewed regularly \\nand extended or shortened as necessary. This review also takes \\naccount of the impact of climate-related aspects on useful lives, \\nfor example due to changes in demand patterns or regulatory re-\\nquirements. This assessment is based on the assumptions used \\nfor long-term corporate planning purposes and product -related \\ndecisions, as described above. Climate-related aspects have an \\nindirect impact on the utilisation of property, plant and equip-\\nment. Adjustments to the useful lives of items of plant and ma-\\nchinery are avoided by a combination of flexible manufacturing \\narrangements (independent of drivetrain type and capable of \\nhandling all vehicle generations) and asset-preservation \\nmeasures. The useful lives of plant and machinery that are used \\nexclusively for internal combustion vehicle production are also \\ncovered by the most up-to-date planning assumptions. For ma-\\nchinery used in multiple -shift operations, depreciation rates are \\nincreased to account for the additional utilisation. If there is any \\nindication of impairment of property, plant and equipment, an im-\\npairment test is performed as described above for intangible as-\\nsets. '),\n",

Depending on the specific \\nfacts and circumstances of each individual case, power purchase \\nagreements and long-term supply contracts for battery cells may \\nalso constitute a lease.  \\nThe BMW Group recognises a right -of-use asset and a liability \\nfor the outstanding lease payments with effect from the date on \\nwhich the leased asset becomes available for use by the BMW \\nGroup. The cost of the right -of-use asset is the sum of the \\namount at which the lease liability is initially measured, any lease \\npayments made at or before the lease commencement date, any \\ninitial direct costs incurred by the lessee and the estimated costs \\nof dismantling, removing or restoring the leased asset. Lease in-\\ncentives granted by the lessor are deducted. Right-of-use assets \\nare depreciated on a straight -line basis over the shorter of the \\nuseful life of the leased asset and the expected lease term. If \\nownership of the leased asset is automatically transferred at the \\nend of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is re-\\nflected in the lease payments, the right-of-use asset is depreci-\\nated on a straight -line basis over the expected usef ul life of the \\nleased asset. Right -of-use assets are reported in the balance \\nsheet within the relevant line items for property, plant and equip-\\nment. The depreciation expense on right-of-use assets is re-\\nported in the income statement in cost of sales as well as in sell-\\ning and administrative expenses. \\nThe lease liability is measured on initial recognition at the present \\nvalue of the future lease payments. Subsequent to initial recog-\\nnition, the carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to \\nreflect interest on the lease liability and reduced, without income \\nstatement impact, by the lease payments made. Lease liabilities \\nare reported within financial liabilities, while interest expense is \\nreported as part of net interest result. In the cash flow statement, \\nboth the repayment portion and the interest portion of lease pay-\\nments are shown as cash outflows from financing activities. \\nThe lease payments to be taken into account to measure the \\nright-of-use asset and the lease liability comprise fixed pay-\\nments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or an \\ninterest rate as well as amounts expected to be payable under \\nresidual value guarantees. If it is reasonably certain that a pur-\\nchase or lease extension option will be exercised, the relevant \\npayments are also included. Payments for periods for which the \\nlessee has an option to terminate a lease unilaterally are only in-\\ncluded in the lease payments if it is reasonably certain that the \\ntermination option will not be exercised. For the purposes of as-\\nsessing options, the BMW Group takes account of all facts and \\ncircumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or \\nnot to exercise the option. \\nIFRS 16 requires that lease payments are discounted as a gen-\\neral rule using the interest rate implicit in the le ase. However, \\nsince the interest rate in leases entered into by the BMW Group \\ncannot readily be determined, amounts are discounted on the \\nbasis of the incremental borrowing rate. \\nThe incremental borrowing rate comprises the risk -free interest \\nrate in the relevant currency for matching maturities plus a pre-\\nmium for the credit risk. Specific risks attached to an asset are \\ngenerally not taken into account, given that collateral received in \\nthe context of alternative financing arrangements is not relevant \\nwithin the BMW Group. \\nDetermining which items are to be counted as lease payments – \\nincluding the issue of the lease term underlying those payments \\n– and which discount rate to apply involves using estimates and \\nassumptions that may differ from actual outcomes. \\nAs lessee, the BMW Group makes use of the application exemp-\\ntions available for short-term leases and leases of low -value  \\nassets. \\nGroup products recognised by BMW Group entities as leased \\nproducts under operating leases are measured at manufactur-\\ning cost and all other leased products at acquisition cost, in each \\ncase including initial direct costs. All leased products are depre-\\nciated over the period of the lease using the straight-line method \\ndown to their expected residual value. \\nWhere the recoverable amount of a lease exceeds the asset’s \\ncarrying amount, changes in residual value expectations are rec-\\nognised by adjusting scheduled depreciation prospectively over \\nthe remaining term of the lease. If the recoverable amount is \\nlower than the asset ’s carrying amount, an impairment loss is \\nrecognised for the shortfall. A test is carried out at each balance \\nsheet date to determine whether an impairment loss recognised \\nin prior years no longer exists or has decreased. In such cases, \\nthe carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable \\namount, at a maximum up to the amount of the asset’s amor-\\ntised cost. \\nAssumptions and estimations are required regarding future re-\\nsidual values, since these represent a significant part of future \\ncash inflows. Relevant factors to be considered include the trend \\nin market prices and demand on the pre-owned automobile mar-\\nket. The expected change in the drive-system mix going forward, \\nwhich is subject to regular analysis, is also taken into account. \\nThe BMW Group has developed and implemented methods and \\nprocesses that enable sustainability aspects of residual value \\nrisks, particularly climate-related aspects, to be appropriately as-\\nsessed and managed. A scenario -based approach is applied to \\nquantify the impact of the transition towards zero-emissions mo-\\nbility and factor in the technological progress of the products in-\\nvolved, resulting potentially in the need to adjust the estimated \\nresidual values of both internal combustion and electrified vehi-\\ncles. However, the transition to new drive systems will stretch \\nover a period of time. Under these circumstances, regulatory as-\\npects, customer behaviour and the structure of the product range \\nall have to be taken into account. To varying degrees, the afore-\\nmentioned aspects will play a role in bringing about changes to \\nthe existing product portfolio over the coming years. The nature \\nof these planned changes can already be anticipated today to \\nsome extent, highlighting potential but calculable risks for future \\noperations. Disproportionate risks can only arise in the  '),\n",

In addition to these various considera-\\ntions, the vehicle portfolio subject to residual value risks is re-\\nmeasured on a quarterly basis, allowing new aspects to be incor-\\nporated in the valuation at an early stage. In this case, valuations \\nrelevant for new business which are subject to the same turn of \\nevents would also be adjusted. The forecasting models used by \\nthe BMW Group are subject to regular review and can be supple-\\nmented where appropriate to include aspects relating to changes \\nin the market. \\nUsing this approach, upward or downward adjustments can be \\nmade to the forecast value on the basis of a range of scenario \\nanalyses. The assumptions are based on internally available his-\\ntorical data and current market data as well as on forecasts of \\nexternal institutions. Furthermore, assumptions are regularly val-\\nidated by comparison with external data. Certain types of con-\\ntracts require a high degree of judgement when deciding whether \\nthey give rise to operating leases or receivables from sales  \\nfinancing. \\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method  are \\nmeasured – provided no impairment has b een recognised – at \\ncost of investment adjusted for the Group’s share of earnings \\nand changes in equity capital. If there is any indication that an \\ninvestment is impaired, an impairment test is performed on the \\nbasis of the discounted cash flow method. An indicator exists, for \\nexample, in the event of a serious shortfall compared to budget, \\nthe loss of an active market or if funds are required to avoid \\ninsolvency. \\nWith the exception of lease receivables financial assets are \\nmeasured on initial recognition at their fair value. Financial as-\\nsets include, in particular, other investments, receivables from \\nsales financing, finance-related receivables , trade receivables  \\nand cash and cash equivalents. As a general rule, initial recogni-\\ntion takes place as soon as the BMW Group becomes a party to \\na contract. In the case of so- called “regular way” purchases or \\nsales of non -derivative financial assets, initial recognition takes \\nplace at the settlement date. Financial assets are derecognised \\nwhen contractual cash flows attached to them have expired or \\nare transferred and all significant risks and rewards have been \\npassed on to the acquirer. \\nDepending on the business model and the structure of contrac-\\ntual cash flows, financial assets are classified as measured at \\namortised cost, at fair value through comprehensive income or at \\nfair value through profit or loss. The category “measured at fair \\nvalue through comprehensive income” at the BMW Group com-\\nprises mainly marketable securities and investment funds used \\nfor liquidity management purposes. In the BMW Group, selected \\nmarketable securities, shares in investment funds, money mar-\\nket funds and convertible bonds are measured at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss, as their contractual cash flows do not solely \\nrepresent payments of principal and interest. \\nThe BMW Group does not make use of the option to measure \\nequity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive in-\\ncome or debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss. \\nThe market values of financial instruments meas ured at fair \\nvalue are determined on the basis of market information avail -\\nable at the balance sheet date, such as quoted prices or using \\nappropriate measurement methods, in particular the discounted \\ncash flow method. \\nItems reported under other investments  within the scope of \\nIFRS 9 are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Invest-\\nments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated com-\\npanies that are not material to the BMW Group are also included \\nin other investments. \\nReceivables from sales f inancing are measured as a general \\nrule at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  \\nAs part of its asset -backed securities (ABS) financing activities, \\nthe BMW Group transfers some of its receivables from sales fi-\\nnancing – primarily retail customer and dealership financing re-\\nceivables – to structured companies, which in turn securitise \\nthem and place them on the capital market as collateralised  \\nsecurities. \\nThe transferred receivables are not derecognised and therefore \\nremain on the BMW Group’s balance sheet. For this reason, re-\\nceivables from sales financing fulfil the criteria of the ”hold” busi-\\nness model. \\nReceivables from sales financing also include finance lease re-\\nceivables which are measured at the amount of the net invest-\\nment in the lease. This balance sheet line item also includes op-\\nerating lease receivables at the end of the reporting period. The \\nrelated vehicles are reported within the line item “Leased  \\nproducts”. \\nWith the exception of receivables from operating leases and \\ntrade receivables, the BMW Group applies the general approach \\ndescribed in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of financial assets. \\nUnder the general approach, loss allowances are measured on \\ninitial recognition on the basis of the expected 12-month credit \\nloss (stage 1). If the credit loss risk at the end of the reporting \\nperiod has increased significantly since initial recognition, the im-\\npairment allowance is measured on the basis of lifetime ex-\\npected credit losses (stage 2 – general approach). The measure-\\nment of the change in default risk is based on a comparison of \\nthe default risk at the date of initial recognition and at the end of \\nthe reporting period. The default risk at the end of each reporting \\nperiod is determined on the basis of credit checks, current key \\nperformance indicators and any overdue payments. '),\n",

For the purposes of \\nallocating an item to stage 2, it is irrelevant whether the credit \\nrisk of the assets concerned has increased significantly since in-\\nitial recognition. \\nAs a general rule, the BMW Group assumes that a receivable is \\nin default if it is more than 90 days overdue or if there are objec-\\ntive indications of insolvency, such as the opening of insolvency \\nproceedings. Credit-impaired assets are identified as such on the \\nbasis of this definition of default. In the case of credit -impaired \\nassets which had not been credit-impaired at the time they were \\nacquired or originated, an impairment allowance is recognised at \\nan amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (stage 3). This \\nis the case regardless of whether the general or simplified ap-\\nproach is applied. In the case of stage 3 assets, interest income \\nis calculated on the asset’s carrying amount less any impairment \\nloss. \\nIn addition, post-model adjustments are recorded if the risk is not \\nfully covered by the standard models.  \\nThe BMW Group derecognises financial assets when it has no \\nreasonable expectation of recovery. This may be the case, for in-\\nstance, if the debtor is deemed not to have sufficient assets or \\nother sources of income to service the debt.  \\nLoss allowances relating to the balance sheet line item “Receiv-\\nables from sales financing” are determined primarily on the basis \\nof past experience with credit losses, current data on overdue re-\\nceivables, rating classes and scoring information.  \\nForward-looking information (for instance for ecasts of key per-\\nformance indicators) is also taken into account if, based on past \\nexperience, such indicators show a substantive correlation to ac-\\ntual credit losses. \\nLoss allowances on trade receivables are determined primarily \\non the basis of information relating to overdue amounts. Further-\\nmore, both positive and negative economic scenarios are used \\nalongside the latest forecasts of key performance indicators \\nwhen determining the level of valuation allowances. These sce-\\nnarios are based on local analyses and take into account, for ex-\\nample, anticipated political and economic developments.  \\nInput factors available on the market, such as ratings and prob-\\nabilities of default, are used to calculate valuation allowances for \\ncash and cash equivalents, financial assets, receivables from \\nsubsidiaries and receivables from companies in which an invest-\\nment is held. In the case of marketable securities and investment \\nfunds, the BMW Group usually applies the option not to allocate \\nfinancial assets with a low default risk to different stages. Accord-\\ningly, assets with an investment grade rating are always allo-\\ncated to stage 1. \\nFinancial assets include in particular marketable securities and \\nshares in investment funds as well as derivative financial instru-\\nments. \\nDerivative fi nancial instruments  are used within the BMW \\nGroup for hedging purposes in order to reduce currency, interest \\nrate, fair value and market price risks. Derivative financial instru-\\nments are recognised as of the trade date, measured at their fair \\nvalue. Depending on their market value at measurement date, \\nthese financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet line \\nitems “Financial assets” or “Financial liabilities”. \\nFair values are determined on the basis of valuation models. Ob-\\nservable market price, tenor and currency basis spreads are \\ntaken into account in the measurement of derivative financial in-\\nstruments. Furthermore, the Group’s own credit risk and that of \\ncounterparties is taken into account on the basis of credit default \\nswap values for market contracts with matching terms. \\nThe BMW Group applies the option to recognise the credit risks \\narising from the fair values of a group of derivative financial as-\\nsets and liabilities on the basis of their total net amount. Portfo-\\nlio-based valuation adjustments (credit valuation adjustments \\nand debit valuation adjustments) to the individual derivative fi-\\nnancial assets and financial liabilities are allocated using the rel-\\native fair value approach (net method). \\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, changes in fair value of de-\\nrivative financial instruments are presented as part of other fi-\\nnancial result in the income statement or within other compre-\\nhensive income as a component of accumulated other equity, \\ndepending on whether the hedging relationship is classified as a \\nfair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. \\nFair value hedges are mainly used to hedge interest rate risks \\nrelating to financial liabilities. The currency basis is not desig-\\nnated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of cross cur-\\nrency interest rate hedges accounted for as fair value hedges. \\nAccordingly, changes in the market value of such components \\nare recorded as costs of hedging within accumulated other eq-\\nuity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to other fi-\\nnancial result within the income statement over the term of the \\nhedging relationship. \\nIn addition, for selected fixed-interest assets, a portion of the in-\\nterest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis in accordance with  '),\n",

The designated hedged items (underlying transactions) \\nare reported in the balance sheet as receivables from sales fi-\\nnancing or financial liabilities. Interest rate risks are hedged on \\nthe basis of the present value of net cash flows relating to fixed \\nincome assets (on the asset side) less cash flows relating to vari-\\nable-rate financing (on the liabilities side). The net cash flow de-\\ntermined in this way is hedged by purchasing corresponding in-\\nterest rate swaps that have the effect of reducing the interest rate \\nrisk. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a \\nmonthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking \\naccount of the constantly changing content of each portfolio. \\nFair value hedge ineffectiveness is generally recognised in other \\nfinancial result. \\nThe time values of option transactions and the interest compo-\\nnent – including the currency basis – of forward currency con-\\ntracts are not designated as part of the hedging relationship in \\nthe case of currency hedges accounted for as cash flow hedges. \\nChanges in the fair value of such components are recorded as \\ncosts of hedging on a separate line within accumulated other  \\nequity. Amounts recorded in accumulated other equity from cur-\\nrency hedges are reclassified to cost of sales when the related \\nhedged item is recognised in profit or loss. \\nIn the case of raw materials hedges that are accounted for as \\ncash flow hedges, the hedging instruments are designated in full \\nas part of the hedging relationship. Amounts recorded in accu-\\nmulated other equity are included in the carrying amount of in-\\nventories on initial recognition. Ineffectiveness arising on cash \\nflow hedges is recognised directly in cost of sales, whereas the \\nimpact of prematurely terminated hedging relationships is recog-\\nnised in other operating income and expenses. \\nDeferred income taxes are recognised for all temporary differ-\\nences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and lia-\\nbilities, including differences arising on consolidation procedures, \\nas well as on unused tax losses and unused tax credits, when it \\nis probable that they can be utilised. As an exception to this, de-\\nferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the implementation \\nof the Pillar Two rules are not recognised. Further information is \\nprovided in ↗ note 5. \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates \\nthat are expected to apply to the period when the asset is real-\\nised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that \\nhave been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet \\ndate. \\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed at each bal-\\nance sheet date on the basis of planned taxable income in future \\nfinancial years. If with a probability of more than 50% future tax \\nbenefits will not be realised, either in part or in total, a valuation \\nallowance is recognised on the deferred tax assets. The calcula-\\ntion of deferred tax assets requires assumptions to be made with \\nregard to the level of future taxable income and the timing of re-\\ncovery of deferred tax assets. These assumptions take account \\nof forecast operating results, announced legislative changes in \\nconnection with climate change and the impact on earnings of \\nthe reversal of taxable temporary differences. Since future busi-\\nness developments cannot be predicted with certainty and to \\nsome extent cannot be influenced by the BMW Group, the meas-\\nurement of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty.  \\nDeferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising \\nfrom investments in subsidiaries, branches and associated com-\\npanies as well as interests in joint arrangements are not recog-\\nnised if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal and \\nit is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the \\nforeseeable future. This is particularly the case if it is intended \\nthat profits will not be distributed, but rather will be used to main-\\ntain the substance and expand the volume of business of the en-\\ntities concerned. \\nCurrent income taxes are calculated within the BMW Group on \\nthe basis of tax legislation applicable in the relevant countries. To \\nthe extent that judgement was necessary to determine the treat-\\nment and amount of tax items presented in the financial state-\\nments, there is in principle a possibility that local tax authorities \\nmay take a different position. \\nAs a general rule, each income tax treatment is considered inde-\\npendently when accounting for uncertainties in income taxes . \\nIf it is not considered probable that an income tax treatment will \\nbe accepted by the local tax authorities, the BMW Group uses the \\nmost likely amount of the tax treatment when determining tax-\\nable profit and the tax base. \\nInventories of raw materials, supplies and goods for resale are \\ngenerally stated at the lower of average acquisition cost and net \\nrealisable value. \\nWork in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of \\nmanufacturing cost and net realisable value. Manufacturing cost \\ncomprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manu-\\nfacturing process as well as an appropriate proportion of produc-\\ntion-related overheads. This includes production-related depre-\\nciation and amortisation and an appropriate proportion of ad-\\nministrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in \\nthe acquisition or manufacturing cost of inventories. \\nInventories also include vehicles held for sale in the financial ser-\\nvices business, measured at their amortised cost or lower net re-\\nalisable value. \\nCash and cash equivalents comprise mainly cash on hand and \\ncash at bank with an original term of up to three months. With the \\nexception of money market funds, cash and cash equivalents are \\nmeasured at amortised cost. '),\n",

For these \\npurposes, transaction costs are taken into account except in the \\ncase of financial liabilities allocated to the category “measured at \\nfair value through profit or loss”. Subsequent to initial recognition, \\nliabilities are – with the exception of derivative financial instru-\\nments – measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nmethod. \\nProvisions for pensions are measured using the projected unit \\ncredit method. Under this method, not only obligations relating to \\nknown vested benefits at the reporting date are recognised, but \\nalso the effect of future expected increases in pensions and sal-\\naries. The calculation is based on independent actuarial valua-\\ntions which take into account the relevant biometric factors. \\nIn the case of funded plans, the pension obligation is offset \\nagainst plan assets measured at their fair value. If the plan as-\\nsets exceed the pension obligation, the surplus is tested for re-\\ncoverability. In the event that the BMW Group has a right of reim-\\nbursement or a right to reduce future contributions, it reports an \\nasset (within Other financial assets), measured on the basis of \\nthe present value of the future economic benefits attached to the \\nplan assets. For funded plans, in cases where the obligation ex-\\nceeds plan assets, a liability is recognised under pension provi-\\nsions. \\nThe calculation of the amount of the provision requires assump-\\ntions to be made with regard to discount rates, pension trends, \\nemployee fluctuation and the life expectancy of employees, \\namong other things. Discount rates are determined by reference \\nto market yields at the end of the reporting period on high-quality \\nfixed-interest corporate bonds. \\nNet interest expense on the net defined benefit liability or net in-\\nterest income on the net defined benefit assets are presented \\nseparately within the financial result. All other costs relating to \\nallocations to pension provisions are allocated to costs by func-\\ntion in the income statement. \\nPast service cost arises where a BMW Group company intro-\\nduces a defined benefit plan or changes the benefits payable un-\\nder an existing plan. This cost is recognised immediately in the \\nincome statement. Similarly, gains and losses arising on the set-\\ntlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised immediately in \\nthe income statement. \\nRemeasurement of the net liability can result from changes in the \\npresent value of the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of \\nthe plan assets or the asset ceiling. Remeasurement can result, \\namongst others, from changes in financial and demographic pa-\\nrameters, as well as changes following the portfolio develop-\\nment. Remeasurements are recognised immediately through \\nother comprehensive income and ultimately in equity (within rev-\\nenue reserves). \\nOther provisions are recognised when the BMW Group has a \\npresent legal or factual obligation towards a third p arty arising \\nfrom past events, the settlement of which is probable and when \\nthe amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provi-\\nsions with a remaining period of more than one year are meas-\\nured at their net present value. \\nThe measurement of provisions for  statutory and non -\\nstatutory warranty obligations (statutory, contractual and \\nvoluntary) involves estimations. In addition to manufacturer \\nwarranties prescribed by law, the BMW Group offers various fur-\\nther standard (assurance type) warranties depending on the \\nproduct and sales market. No provisions are recognised for ad-\\nditionally offered service packages that are treated as separate \\nperformance obligations. \\nProvisions for statutory and non-statutory warranties are recog-\\nnised at the point in time whe n control over the goods is trans-\\nferred to the dealership or retail customer or when it is decided \\nto introduce new warranty measures. With respect to the level of \\nthe provision, estimations are made in particular based on past \\nexperience of damage claims and processes. Future potential re-\\npair costs and price increases per product and market are also \\ntaken into account. Provisions for warranties for all companies of \\nthe BMW Group are adjusted regularly to take account of new \\ninformation, with the impact of any changes recognised in the in-\\ncome statement. Further information is provided in ↗ note 34. Sim-\\nilar estimates are also made in conjunction with the measure-\\nment of expected reimbursement claims. \\nThe recognition and measurement of provisions for  litigation \\nand liability risks  necessitate making assumptions in order to \\ndetermine the probability of liability, the amount of claim and the \\nduration of the legal dispute. The assumptions made, especially \\nthe assumption about the outcome of legal proceedings, are sub-\\nject to a high degree of uncertainty. The appropriateness of as-\\nsumptions is regularly reviewed, based on assessments under-\\ntaken both by management and external experts, such as law-\\nyers. If new developments arise in the future that result in a dif-\\nferent assessment, provisions are adjusted accordingly. \\nIf the recognition criteria relevant for provisions are not fulfilled \\nand the outflow of resources on fulfilment is not unlikely, the po-\\ntential obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability.

Under these rules, the BMW Group will be required pay a \\ntop-up tax to the extent that the Pillar Two specific tax rate in \\neach jurisdiction where it operates falls below the minimum rate \\nof 15%. The Pillar Two model rules have been implemented in \\nGermany with effect for financial years beginning after 31 De-\\ncember 2023. The BMW Group is therefore not subject to a Pillar \\nTwo tax expense for the financial year 2023. The impact of the \\nPillar Two model rules from the financial year 2024 onwards is \\ncurrently being assessed. For this purpose, the jurisdictions that \\ncould be affected by a top -up tax based on a preliminary Pillar \\nTwo calculation have been analysed for the BMW Group, taking \\ninto account the statutory temporary simplification rules (for so-\\ncalled “transitional safe harbours”). Based on the results of the \\nanalysis to date, the tax expense arising in the relevant jurisdic-\\ntions is estimated to be immaterial for the BMW Group. The BMW \\nGroup is already applying the exemption relating to the recogni-\\ntion of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with Pillar \\nTwo. Further information is provided in ↗ note 5. \\nDeferred taxes are determined on the basis of tax rates which \\nare currently applicable or expected to apply in the relevant na-\\ntional jurisdictions when the amounts are recovered. After taking \\naccount of an average municipal trade tax multiplier rate (Hebe-\\nsatz) of 430% (2022: 430%), the underlying income tax rate for \\nGermany was as follows: \\nin %  2023  2022 \\nCorporate tax rate  15.0  15.0 \\nSolidarity surcharge  5.5  5.5 \\nCorporate tax rate including \\nsolidarity surcharge  15.8  15.8 \\nMunicipal trade tax rate  15.1  15.1 \\nGerman income tax rate  30.9  30.9 \\n    \\nDeferred taxes for non-German entities are calculated on the ba-\\nsis of the relevant country-specific tax rates.

Of these loss carryforwards, \\n€ 349 million ( 2022: €  382 million) can be used indefinitely, \\nwhile € 33 million (2022: € 34 million) expires after one to three \\nyears. \\nA net surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities \\namounting to € 95 million (2022: € 1,966 million) is reported for \\nentities that have suffered tax losses in the financial year 2023 \\nor the preceding year.

As in previous years, deferred tax assets recog-\\nnised on these tax losses amounting to € 461 million (2022: \\n€ 464 million) were fully written down since they can only be uti-\\nlised against future capital gains. \\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted for \\neach relevant tax entity if they relate to the same tax authorities. \\nThe change in deferred taxes relating to amounts recognised  \\nwith income effect or without income effect is shown in the fol-\\nlowing reconciliation: \\n   \\nThe effects in connection with the first -time consolidation of \\nBMW Brilliance in the previous year gave rise primarily to net de-\\nferred tax liabilities relating to the remeasurement of the assets \\nacquired and liabilities assumed as part of the purchase price  \\nallocation. \\nNo deferred taxes are recognised on taxable temporary differ-\\nences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associated com-\\npanies and joint ventures if the BMW Group is able determine the \\ntiming of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is prob-\\nable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the fore-\\nseeable future, in particular in view of the fact that there is no in-\\ntention to distribute the profits, but rather to use them to maintain \\nsubstance and reinvest in the companies concerned. Temporary \\ndifferences of this kind, for which no deferred taxes were recog-\\nnised, amounted to € 36,081 million (2022: € 32,882 million). \\nNo computation was made of the potential impact of income \\ntaxes on the grounds of proportionality. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDeferred tax liabilities on expected dividends amounted to \\n€ 187 million (2022: € 199 million) and related primarily to divi-\\ndends from foreign subsidiaries. \\nThe tax returns of BMW Group entities are checked regularly by \\nGerman and foreign tax authorities.

Also included \\nare subsidies for tool costs, licences, purchased development \\nprojects, emissions allowances, software and purchased cus-\\ntomer bases. \\nOther intangible assets include brand-name rights amounting to \\n€ 96 million (2022: € 95 million) which are allocated to the Au-\\ntomotive segment and are not subject to scheduled amortisation \\nsince their useful life is deemed to be indefinite. The brand-name \\nrights are, to an extent, subject to a limited right of ownership . \\nIntangible assets also include goodwill of € 33 million \\n(2022: € 33 million) allocated to the Automotive excluding BMW \\nBrilliance cash -generating unit (CGU) and goodwill of \\n€ 1,107 million ( 2022: € 1,182 million) allocated to the BMW \\nBrilliance CGU. Goodwill amounting to € 347 million \\n(2022: € 347 million) related to the Financial Services CGU. \\nAs in the previous year, there was no requirement to recognise \\nimpairment losses or reversals of impairment losses on intan - \\ngible assets in 2023. \\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a \\ncost component of intangible assets in 2023. \\nIn 2023, government grants totalling € 2 million (2022: € 0 mil-\\nlion) were deducted from the acquisition cost of intangible assets \\nfor the first time. These grants include public sector funds aimed \\nat promoting development. \\n \\n \\n \\n22 Property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use \\nassets arising from leasing) \\nNo impairment losses were recognised in 2023, as in the previ-\\nous year. \\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a \\ncost component of property, plant and equipment in 2023. \\nRight-of-use assets arising from leases of land and buildings re-\\nlate primarily to logistics and office premises and, to a lesser ex-\\ntent, to selling and production premises. In order to secure these \\npremises and, in the interests of flexibility, the property rental \\nagreements concerned often contain extension and termination \\noptions. \\nIn 2023, government grants t otalling € 121 million (2022: \\n€ 0 million) were deducted from the acquisition cost of property, \\nplant and equipment for the first time. These amounts relate \\nmainly to public sector grants aimed at the promotion of regional \\nstructures as well as to subsidies received for plant expansions. \\nThe regular review of the useful lives of items of property, plant \\nand equipment subject to systematic depreciation takes into ac-\\ncount the assumptions contained in the long-term corporate \\nplan, and hence the ongoing transformation towards electric mo-\\nbility as well as the associated short- and medium-term impact \\non the product portfolio. The review of useful lives did not lead to \\nany material adjustments in the financial year 2023. \\n23 Leased products \\nMinimum lease payments of non -cancellable operating leases \\nfall due as follows: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nwithin one year  9,601  9,606 \\nbetween one and two years  6,872  6,522 \\nbetween two and three years  3,875  3,465 \\nbetween three and four years  1,813  1,512 \\nbetween four and five years  305  265 \\nlater than five years  52  38 \\nMinimum lease payments  22,518  21,408 \\n    \\nImpairment losses amounting to € 553 million ( 2022: \\n€ 527 million) were recognised on leased products in 2023 as a \\nconsequence of changes in residual value expectations. Income \\nfrom the reversal of impairment losses amounted to € 274 mil-\\nlion (2022: € 282 million). \\nIn 2023, public sector  grants totalling € 252 million \\n(2022: € 0 million) were deducted from the acquisition cost of \\nleased products for the first time. These amounts relate mainly \\nto investment tax credits in the form of tax credits for electric ve-\\nhicles. It is expected that the investment tax credits can be uti-\\nlised. The actual utilisation of investment tax credits will, how-\\never, depend on the extent to which they can be offset against \\nincome tax liabilities and is therefore subject to a degree of  \\nuncertainty.

Within the Financial Services seg-\\nment, however, there are a number of individual entities which \\nare subject to equity capital requirements of relevant regulatory \\nbanking authorities. \\nIn order to manage its capital structure, the BMW Group uses \\nvarious instruments, including the amount of dividends paid to \\nshareholders and share buybacks. Moreover, the BMW Group \\nactively manages debt capital, carrying out funding activities with \\na target debt structure in mind. \\nA key aspect in the selection of financial instruments is the ob-\\njective to achieve matching maturities for the Group’s financing \\nrequirements.

In addition to retirement benefits, pension benefits \\nalso include disability and surviving dependents’ benefits. The \\nlevel of ongoing pension payments is adjusted in accordance with \\n§ 16 of the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz). \\nTwo employer-funded pension plans are in place that are based \\non defined contributions for which the level of benefits depends \\non developments on the capital markets. Benefits granted by the \\ntwo plans are funded by a combination of the payment of fixed \\nmonthly contributions by the Company, a deferred remuneration \\noption for employees and a matching contribution by the Com-\\npany. Further contributions are made on the basis of the BMW \\nGroup’s performance. A further plan is in place that is funded en-\\ntirely out of deferred remuneration. Due to the minimum interest \\nrate guaranteed by the BMW Group, these plans are all classified \\nas defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19. In addition to \\nthe above plans, an employer-funded, defined benefit pension  \\nplan with lifelong pension benefits remains in place which is now \\nclosed to new entrants. The pension benefit is calculated by mul-\\ntiplying a fixed amount by the number of completed years of ser-\\nvice. Only employees who have not agreed to a one -time option \\nto switch to the defined contribution system will receive future in-\\ncreases in entitlements under this plan. \\nThe assets of the German pension plans are invested by BMW \\nTrust (a German association) in accordance with a CTA. The rep-\\nresentative bodies of the association are the Board of Directors \\nand the Members’ General Meeting. BMW Trust currently has \\nseven members and three members of the Board of Directors \\nelected by the Members’ General Meeting. The Board of Directors \\nis responsible for investments, drawing u p and deciding on in-\\nvestment guidelines as well as monitoring compliance with those \\nguidelines. The members of the association can be employees, \\nemployee representatives, senior executives and members of the \\nBoard of Management of BMW AG. An ordinary Members' Gen-\\neral Meeting takes place once every calendar year, and deals with \\na range of matters, including receiving and approving the associ-\\nation’s annual report, ratifying the activities of the Board of Direc-\\ntors and adopting changes to the association’s statutes. \\nUK \\nDefined benefit plans exist in the UK which are closed for all plan \\nparticipants. Vested benefits remain in place. New benefits are \\ncovered by contributions made to a defined contribution plan. \\nThe defined benefit pension plans are administered by BMW \\nPension Trustees Limited, Farnborough, and BMW (UK) Trustees \\nLimited, Farnborough, both trustee companies which act inde-\\npendently of the BMW Group. BMW (UK) Trustees Limited, Farn-\\nborough, is represented by ten trustees and BMW Pension Trus-\\ntees Limited, Farnborough, by five trustees.

Plan assets of the BMW Group include ow n \\ntransferable financial instruments amounting to € 17 million \\n(2022: € 7 million). \\nThe BMW Group is exposed to risks arising both from defined \\nbenefit plans and defined contribution plans with a minimum re-\\nturn guarantee. The discount rates used to calculate pension ob-\\nligations are subject to market fluctuations and therefore influ-\\nence the level of the obligations. Furthermore, changes in other \\nactuarial parameters, such as expected rates of inflation, also \\nhave an impact on pension obligations. In order to reduce cur-\\nrency exposures, a substantial portion of plan assets is either in-\\nvested in the same currency as the underlying plan or hedged by \\nmeans of currency derivatives. As part of the internal reporting \\nprocedures and for internal management purposes, financial \\nrisks relating to the pension plans are reported using a value-at-\\nrisk approach by reference to the pension deficit. The investment \\nstrategy is also subject to regular review together with external \\nconsultants, with the aim of ensuring that investments are struc-\\ntured to match the timing of pension payments and the expected \\ndevelopment of pension obligations. In this way, fluctuations in \\npension provisions recognised in the balance sheet are reduced. \\n \\n  Germany  United Kingdom  Other  Total \\n                 \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022  31.12.2023  31.12.2022  31.12.2023  31.12.2022  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nEquity instruments  2,729  2,068  –  14  41  37  2,770  2,119 \\nDebt instruments  6,561  6,101  4,237  4,343  53  51  10,851  10,495 \\nthereof investment grade  5,479  5,436  4,237  4,343  53  51  9,769  9,830 \\nthereof mixed funds \\n(funds without a rating)  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  – \\nthereof non-investment grade  1,082  665  –  –  –  –  1,082  665 \\nReal estate funds  51  –  –  –  27  28  78  28 \\nMoney market funds  –  –  51  35  27  15  78  50 \\nAbsolute return funds  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  – \\nOther  289  232  –  –  1  –  290  232 \\nTotal with quoted market price   9,630  8,401  4,288  4,392  149  131  14,067  12,924 \\nDebt instruments  341  340  682  55  1  4  1,024  399 \\nthereof investment grade  336  332  –  –  –  –  336  332 \\nthereof mixed funds \\n(funds without a rating)  5  8  682  55  –  –  687  63 \\nthereof non-investment grade  –  –  –  –  1  4  1  4 \\nReal estate  431  455  622  700  –  –  1,053  1,155 \\nCash and cash equivalents  73  32  –  –  –  –  73  32 \\nAbsolute return funds  466  843  52  640  –  2  518  1,485 \\nOther  1,587  1,437  435  347  590  604  2,612  2,388 \\nTotal without quoted market price   2,898  3,107  1,791  1,742  591  610  5,280  5,459 \\nTotal plan assets  12,528  11,508  6,079  6,134  740  741  19,347  18,383 '),\n",

This assessment \\nmay change over time and is adjusted regularly on the basis of \\nnew information and circumstances. A part of the risks is covered \\nby insurance. \\nThe EU Commission’s antitrust proceedings were  settled on 8 \\nJuly 2021 (see ↗ note [10] to the BMW Group Financial State-\\nments for the financial year 2021 included in the BMW Group \\nReport 2021). \\nIn addition, respective antitrust proceedings were opened \\nagainst BMW AG by the Chinese State Administration for Market \\nRegulation in March 2019 and the Korea Fair Trade Commission \\nin May 2020. Possible risks for the BMW Group in connection \\nwith the antitrust proceedings in China cannot be currently fore-\\nseen, neither in terms of their outcome nor the amounts involved. \\n \\n \\n \\nIn April 2023, the South Korean antitrust authority imposed a \\nfine of approximately 13 billion South Korean won (approxi-\\nmately € 9 million). BMW AG will no longer take action against \\nthe authority’s decision. \\nIn relation to these allegations, numerous class action lawsuits \\nhave been brought in the USA and Canada in the second half of \\n2017, as well as several individual customers’ lawsuits in South \\nKorea in June 2018. In the USA, the customer class actions were \\nwithdrawn in August 2021 and the dealer class action was dis-\\nmissed in the final instance in June 2022. In Canada, the class \\naction lawsuits have been discontinued without any payments \\nmade by BMW. The individual customers’ lawsuits in South Ko-\\nrea remain at an early stage. Further civil lawsuits based on the \\nallegations are possible going forward. Further disclosures pur-\\nsuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present. \\nBeginning in 2014, regulatory authorities have ordered the BMW \\nGroup to recall various vehicle models in conjunction with airbags \\nsupplied by the Takata group of companies. Provision for the \\ncosts involved has been recognised within warranty provisions. \\nIn addition to the risks already covered by warranty provisions, it \\ncannot be ruled out that further vehicles of the BMW Group will \\nbe affected by future recall actions. Further disclosures pursuant \\nto IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present. \\nIn May 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \\n(NHTSA), an agency of the US federal government, requested a \\nrecall of airbags in the USA that are equipped with airbag inflat-\\nors produced by ARC Automotive. Further implications for the \\nBMW Group in other regions outside of North America as well as \\nimplications from class action lawsuits, which have been brought \\nin this context against the BMW Group in the USA, cannot be  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nestimated at present. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 \\ncannot be provided at present. \\nIn March 2022, the European Commission (EC) conducted in-\\nspections at the premises of automobile manufacturers and as-\\nsociations located in several member states. In parallel, the EC \\nsent out formal requests for information to several automobile \\nmanufacturers, including BMW AG. The inspections and re-\\nquests for information concern possible collusion in relation to \\nthe collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life vehicles and \\nlight commercial vehicles. The inspections were conducted in co-\\nordination with the UK Competition and Markets Authority, which \\nhas initiated formal proceedings in respect of the UK market. The \\ncompetition authorities allege that car manufacturers (i) coordi-\\nnated the remuneration to be paid to dismantlers for the provi-\\nsion of their services and (ii) agreed that issues related to end -\\nof-life vehicles should be dealt with in a non -competitive way. \\nAppropriate risk provisions were recognised in the second quar-\\nter 2022 in connection with these investigations. At the current \\nstage of the investigations, further risks for the BMW Group in \\nconnection with the proceedings of the two authorities cannot be \\nquantified at present. In December 2023, the South Korean anti-\\ntrust authority conducted an inspection at the premises of sev-\\neral car manufacturers, including BMW Korea. The investigation \\nby the South Korean antitrust authority has the same back-\\nground as the investigations of the European Commission and \\nthe UK Competition and Markets Authority. Due to the early stage \\nof this investigation, it is also not possible to provide further in-\\nformation in this regard.

Potential risks for the BMW \\nGroup cannot be quantified at the present time. Further disclo-\\nsures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present. \\nIn several recent judgements, the European Court of Justice has \\nruled on emission control systems in diesel vehicles and has sig-\\nnificantly tightened requirements pertaining to the justification of \\nthese systems. As a result of these new judgements by the Eu-\\nropean Court of Justice, the interpretation of regulatory require-\\nments for emission control systems is evolving. This is reflected, \\namongst other things, by the fact that established administrative \\npractices of type approval authorities are being questioned from \\nnumerous sides. This development leads to a reassessment of \\ncivil proceedings pending in Germany due to the emissions per-\\nformance of BMW and MINI diesel vehicles. According to previ-\\nously established case law of German national courts, damage \\nclaims could only be asserted on the basis of intentional damage \\ninflicted in a manner offending common decency. In its most re-\\ncent judgements linked to proceedings against other manufac-\\nturers and taking into account the case law of the European Court \\nof Justice, the German Federal Court of Justice has ruled that a \\nmanufacturer can also be held liable for negligent breach of EU \\nhomologation standards and on the basis of a far-reaching re-\\nversal of the burden of proof to the detriment of the manufac-\\nturer. An increase in the effort and complexity of the defence in \\nindividual cases, an increasing number of new court proceedings, \\nincreased legal risks and increased financial expenditure are to \\nbe expected. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot \\nbe provided at present.  \\nIn addition, the KBA determined in February 2024 that two func-\\ntionalities of the emission control system of the BMW vehicle \\nmodel X3 with 2.0 litre diesel engine (EU5), built between Sep-\\ntember 2010 and March 2014 do not comply with legal require-\\nments. The KBA views these functionalities as prohibited defeat \\ndevices. The BMW Group has filed a timely objection against this \\ndecision. Corrective measures are currently being coordinated \\nwith the responsible type approval authorities. Furthermore, the \\nBMW Group is investigating whether and to what extent function-\\nalities of the emission control systems of this and other past die-\\nsel vehicle models comply with legal requirements and is in dia-\\nlogue with the responsible authorities in this regard. Also, against \\nthe background of the development in case law referred to \\nabove, it is possible that further authorities and/or courts find \\nfault with functionalities of the emission control systems or deem \\nthem as non-compliant with legal requirements. Given that the \\ninvestigations will take some time, it is not  currently possible to \\nmake any disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 with regard to pos-\\nsible measures to be taken, possible effects on administrative \\nand civil court proceedings and any financial risks that may be \\nrelated thereto. \\nFurthermore, several BMW Group entities have been facing a \\nnumber of diesel emissions-related court claims in England and \\nWales since November 2021 as well as in Scotland since March \\n2023. In November 2023, the High Court approved a group liti-\\ngation regarding the proceeding in England and Wales. In De-\\ncember 2023, the court ordered that at least three out of the 16 \\npending court proceedings against OEMs will proceed to trial \\nfrom October 2024 onwards. The proceedings against two other \\nOEMs have already been selected, and the selection of other \\nOEM proceedings is expected to follow in March 2024. In Scot-\\nland, the court also approved the combination of relevant claims \\nin group proceedings. It is estimated that any sued BMW Group \\nentities will have to file their statement of defence in April 2024. \\nGiven that proceedings are still at an early stage, the probability, \\namount or timing of any liability cannot be determined at present. \\nFurther disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at \\npresent. \\nOther financial commitments \\nIn addition to liabilities, provisions and contingent liabilities, the \\nfollowing commitments exist for the BMW Group at the end of the \\nreporting period: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nPurchase commitments for property, plant \\nand equipment  7,712  5,758 \\nPurchase commitments for intangible assets   2,252  1,912 \\n    '),\n",

The valuation of unlisted equity \\ninstruments is determined primarily using the market-based ap-\\nproach. In particular, the financing rounds that take place within \\nthe private equity sector – usually on a regular basis at intervals \\nof approximately 12 to 24 months – represent a significant input \\nfactor for these purposes. In addition, the investment advisor \\nprovides the external fund manager with relevant, investment -\\nspecific information on an ongoing basis (at least quarterly). The \\nlatter subsequently assesses the underlying individual com - \\npanies in accordance with the guidelines for International Private \\nEquity and Venture Capital Valuations (IPEV). \\nAs part of the process of analysing valuations, the external fund \\nmanager reviews the investment -specific milestones, including \\nan analysis of financial, technical and liquidity -specific perfor-\\nmance indicators , among others. Based on this analysis, it is \\nconsidered whether the price of the most recent financing round \\nis accept-able as a reasonable market valuation, in particular for \\nearly-stage or growth -phase investments. Key performance in-\\ndicators used for the purpose of milestone analysis are depend-\\nent on the business model underlying the investment. Typical \\ntechnical key performance indicators relate to licenses and pa-\\ntents held, the stage of technology development such as evi-\\ndence of feasibility and prototypes, market entries, customer and \\nuser growth and appointments to key management positions. \\nKey financial performance indicators used are revenues, EBITDA \\nand the corresponding growth rate and/or development of \\nspecific contribution margins. Key liquidity -specific performance \\nindicators are cash on hand, cash burn rates and  prospects for \\nfuture financing rounds. \\nSince the pricing from the financing rounds is considered to be \\nthe decisive input factor for the valuation, increases and de-\\ncreases in valuation give rise to a similar change in the equity \\ninstrument that is recognised in the income statement. \\nIn addition, equity instruments that are held outside the private \\nequity fund are measured using the income approach. This in-\\nvolves discounting cash flows on the basis of current business \\ncases using the weighted average cost of capital to determine \\nthe fair value of the financial instrument. Changes in fair values \\ndetermined in connection with adjustments to significant input \\nfactors are not material for the BMW Group. \\nThe convertible bonds that have been classified to Level 3 are \\nprimarily used as instruments in advance of future financing \\nrounds relating to private equity investments. Valuations are \\ntherefore performed in accordance with the IPEV guidelines. \\nMandatory conversions are usually structured in such a way that \\nthe number of shares to be received depends on the future share \\nprice. Due to the generally short maturities, the instruments are \\nsubject to only insignificant fluctuations in value. Irrespective of \\nthis fact, impairment tests are performed at regular intervals. \\nThe fair value of the options that the BMW Group holds in shares \\nof such investee companies is measured primarily on the basis \\nof a binomial model, taking into account the respective conditions \\nunder which the options were granted. The comments provided \\non the income -based approach used to measure equity instru-\\nments held outside the private equity fund apply analogously for \\nthe purposes of determining the relevant entity value that is \\ntaken into account when measuring the fair value of the options. \\nThe exercise price for share options arising in conjunction with \\nthe private equity fund is generally low, verging towards zero. \\nConsequently, financing rounds have a direct impact on the fair \\nvalue of the options. In this respect, the valuation of options and \\nassessment of their impact on sensitivity is similar to the  \\napproach taken to unquoted equity instruments, as described \\nabove. '),\n",

Total interest ex-\\npenses arising on financial instruments measured at amortised \\ncost amounted to € 2.5 billion (2022: € 1.7 billion). \\n \\nCredit risk \\nThe BMW Group is exposed to counterparty credit risks if con-\\ntractual partners, for example a retail customer or a dealership, \\nare unable or only partially able to meet their contractual obliga-\\ntions. Information on the management of credit risk for receiv -\\nables from sales financing is provided in the Combined Manage-\\nment Report. (↗ Outlook and ↗ Risks and Opportunities) \\nNotwithstanding the existence of collateral accepted, the carry-\\ning amount of financial assets (with the exception of derivative \\nfinancial instruments) generally represents the maximum credit \\nrisk. In addition, the credit risk is increased by additional unu-\\ntilised loan commitments in the dealership financing line of busi-\\nness. Total dealership financing credit risk at the end of the re-\\nporting period therefore amounted to € 32,149 million ( 2022: \\n€ 31,163 million). \\nIn the case of all relationships underlying non-derivative financial \\ninstruments, in order to minimise the credit risk and depending \\non the nature and amount of exposure, collateral is required, \\ncredit information and references obtained or historical data \\nbased on the existing business relationship, in particular pay-\\nment behaviour, reviewed. \\nIn the case of trade receivables, customers are regularly as-\\nsessed with regard to their credit risk. Depending on contractual \\nstatus, necessary measures, such as dunning procedures, are  \\ninitiated in good time. \\nThe credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial \\ninstruments is minimised by the fact that the Group only enters \\ninto such contracts with parties of first-class credit standing. \\nWithin the financial services business, items financed for retail \\ncustomers and dealerships (such as vehicles, facilities and prop-\\nerty) serve as first-ranking collateral with a recoverable value.  \\nSecurity is also put up by customers in the form of collateral asset \\npledges, asset assignment and first-ranking mortgages, supple-\\nmented where appropriate by warranties and guarantees. Items \\npreviously held as collateral that are subsequently acquired re-\\nlate mainly to vehicles. As a rule, these assets can be converted \\ninto cash at short notice through the dealership organisation. \\nCreditworthiness testing is an important aspect of the BMW \\nGroup’s credit risk management. Every borrower’s creditworthi-\\nness is tested for all credit financing and lease contracts entered \\ninto by the BMW Group. In the case of retail customer financing, \\ncreditworthiness is assessed using validated scoring systems in-\\ntegrated in the purchasing process.  \\nIn the area of dealership financing, creditworthiness is assessed \\nby means of ongoing credit monitoring and an internal rating sys-\\ntem that takes account not only of the material credit standing of \\nthe borrower, but also of qualitative factors, such as past reliabil-\\nity in business relations. \\nThe credit risk on tra de receivables is assessed mainly on the \\nbasis of information relating to overdue amounts. The gross car-\\nrying amounts of these receivables are allocated in accordance \\nwith IFRS 9 to overdue ranges used for management purposes \\nas follows: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nNot overdue  3,718  3,871 \\n1–30 days overdue  339  208 \\n31–60 days overdue  42  31 \\n61–90 days overdue  29  11 \\nMore than 90 days overdue  104  65 \\nTotal  4,232  4,186 \\n    '),\n",

In order to hedge currency risks, the BMW Group \\nholds, as at 31 December 2023, derivative financial instruments \\nmostly in the form of forward currency contracts and currency \\nswaps. \\nAs part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, \\nthe extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided \\nat regular intervals. The economic relationship between the \\nhedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on \\nthe fact that they are denominated in the same currency and \\nhave the same maturities. Items are hedged on the basis of a \\nconstant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk \\nexposure. \\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for \\ncounterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that \\nhave been established for credit risk management, ineffective-\\nness is not expected to arise. \\nThe BMW Group measures currency risk using a cash -flow-at-\\nrisk model. The analysis of currency risk is b ased on forecast \\nforeign currency transactions which could result in exposures to \\nsurpluses of foreign currency cash inflows and cash outflows. At \\nthe end of the reporting period, the overall currency exposure – \\nin each case for the following year and determined by aggregat-\\ning the individual currency exposures based on their absolute \\namount – was as follows: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nCurrency exposure  39,157  43,179 \\n   \\nCurrency exposures include short positions amounting to \\n€ 2,136 million (2022: € 3,604 million). \\nThe currency exposure is compared to all hedges that are in \\nplace. The net cash flow surplus represents an uncovered risk \\nposition. The cash-flow-at-risk approach involves showing the \\nimpact of potential exchange rate fluctuations on operating cash \\nflows on the basis of probability distributions. Volatilities and cor-\\nrelations serve as the main input factors to determine the rele-\\nvant probability distributions. \\nThe potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at the re-\\nporting date for each currency for the following financial year on \\nthe basis of current market prices and exposures with a confi-\\ndence level of 95%. The risk mitigating effect of correlations be-\\ntween the various currencies is taken into account when the risks \\nare aggregated. \\nThe following table shows the potential negative impact for the \\nBMW Group for the following year resulting from unfavourable \\nchanges in exchange rates, measured on the basis of the cash-\\nflow-at-risk approach. \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nCash flow at risk  493  530 \\n   \\nInterest rate risk \\nInterest rate risks arise when funds are borrowed and invested \\nwith differing fixed-rate periods or differing terms. At the BMW \\nGroup, all items subject to, or bearing, interest are exposed to \\ninterest rate risk and can therefore affect both the assets and li-\\nabilities side of the balance sheet.  \\nThe fair value of the Group’s interest rate portfolios was as fol-\\nlows at the end of the reporting period: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nFair values of interest rate portfolios   73,510  73,954 \\n    \\nInterest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate de-\\nrivatives. As part of the implementation of the risk management \\nstrategy, interest rate risks are monitored and managed at regu-\\nlar intervals. The interest rate contracts used for hedging pur-\\nposes comprise mainly swaps, which, if hedge accounting is ap-\\nplied, are accounted for as fair value hedges. The economic re-\\nlationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument \\nis based on the fact that the main parameters of the hedged item \\nand the related hedging instrument (e.g. start date, term and cur-\\nrency) are the same. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant \\nratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk expo-\\nsure. \\nIn view of the fact that own credit risk is excluded from the hedg-\\ning relationship, ineffectiveness is expected to be low. \\nFor selected fixed-interest assets, part of the interest rate risk is \\nhedged on a portfolio basis. In this case, swaps are used as the \\nhedging instrument. Hedge relationships are terminated and re-\\ndesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting pe-\\nriod, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content \\nof each portfolio. \\nIn light of the reform and replacement of certain benchmark in-\\nterest rates, some of the BMW Group’s hedging relation ships \\nhave been redesignated to take account of alternative bench-\\nmark interest rates.

The tasks of the conversion project includes the continual \\nmonitoring of regulatory developments, the initiation of neces-\\nsary changes to systems, processes, risk and measurement \\nmodels as well as the clarification of the associated accounting \\nand financial reporting implications. In the financial year 2023, \\nall contracts based on USD LIBOR were converted to alternative \\nbenchmark interest rates (€ 412 million). \\nIn the case of CAD CDOR and PLN WIBOR, uncertainty remains \\nas to the exact timing and nature of the changes. Non-derivative \\nfinancial instruments that have not been converted to an alterna-\\ntive interest rate at 31 December 2023 all relate to the CAD \\nCDOR, with a nominal liability amount of € 171 million \\n(2022: € 242 million). Derivative financial instruments that have \\nnot been converted to an alternative interest rate at 31  Decem-\\nber 2023 all relate to the PLN WIBOR, with a nominal amount of \\n€ 584 million (2022: € 100 million). \\nThe BMW Group applies a value-at-risk approach throughout the \\nGroup for internal reporting purposes and to manage interest \\nrate risk.  \\nThis approach is based on a historical simulation in which the \\npotential future fair value losses of the interest rate portfolios are \\ncompared across the Group with expected amounts on the basis \\nof a holding period of 250 days and a confidence level of \\n99.98%.

In order to hedge these risks, the Group mainly uses forward \\ncommodity contracts. As part of the implementation of the risk \\nmanagement strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should \\nbe hedged is decided at regular intervals and the corresponding \\nhedging ratio defined. Items are hedged on the basis of a con-\\nstant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk \\nexposure. \\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for \\ncounterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that \\nhave been established for credit risk management, ineffective-\\nness is not expected to arise. \\nThe economic relationship between the hedged item and the \\nhedging instrument is based essentially on the fact that they \\nhave the same basis and term. The BMW Group designates only \\nthe commodity price index-linked raw materials surcharge, which \\nis specified in the purchase contracts of vehicle components , as \\na hedged item. The proportion of the hedged risk component as \\na percentage of the total fair value depends on the specific types \\nof vehicle component involved. Other price components con-\\ntained in the contract are not designated as being part of the \\nhedge relationship as no effective hedging instruments exist for \\nthese components. \\nThe starting point for analysing raw materials price risk is to iden-\\ntify planned purchases of raw materials or components contain-\\ning raw materials, the so-called “exposure”. At each reporting \\ndate, the exposure for the following financial year amounted to: \\nin € million  31.12.2023  31.12.2022 \\nRaw material price exposures  9,033  10,153 \\n    \\nThis exposure is compared to all hedges that are in place.

At their discretion, participants in the \\nprogramme were able to purchase packages of 10, 20, 30, 40 \\nor 50 shares of common stock (2022: 10, 20, 35, 50 or 65 \\nshares of preferred stock) with a discount of € 20.00 (2022: \\n€ 16.00) on each share as compared to the market price (aver-\\nage closing price in Xetra trading in the period 1 to 6 November \\n2023: € 91.47). Employees who are currently employed by \\nBMW AG or a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG based in Ger-\\nmany were able to partake in the programme, insofar as the sub-\\nsidiary’s management had decided to participate. Employees \\nwere required to have been in their positions for at least one year \\nwithout interruption at the time the programme was announced \\nand had to remain in their positions until the shares of common \\nstock were transferred. \\nThe shares of common stock acquired in the scope of the Em-\\nployee Share Programme are subject to a vesting period of four \\nyears calculated from 1 January of the year in which the shares \\nof common stock were acquired. These shares of common stock \\nare entitled to receive dividends for the first time with effect from \\nthe financial year 2023. \\nA total of 1,290,000 shares of common stock were transferred \\nto employees in the reporting year (2022: 1,439,975 shares of \\npreferred stock). The 1,290,000 shares of common stock were \\nacquired in the scope of the Employee Share Programme. The \\n1,439,975 shares of preferred stock in the previous year \\nstemmed from Authorised Capital 2019. BMW AG’s Board of \\nManagement decides each year whether to continue the  \\nprogramme. \\nAs at 31 December 2023, the BMW Group recorded personnel \\nexpenses resulting from the Employee Share Programme relat-\\ning to the difference between the market price and the dis-\\ncounted price for the shares of common and preferred stock, re-\\nspectively, purchased by employees totalling € 28 million (2022: \\n€ 23 million). \\nSenior department head and Board of Management programme \\nBoth the share-based remuneration programme for members of \\nthe Board of Management that was in force in the reporting year \\nand the share-based remuneration programme for eligible sen-\\nior department heads serve to reward long-term entrepreneurial \\nconduct with sustainable business management in mind.  \\nBoard of Management members and eligible senior department \\nheads receive an earmarked cash amount (personal cash invest-\\nment amount) that is, net of tax and deductions, to be invested \\nin shares of BMW AG common stock. This amount depends on \\nthe achievement of certain financial and non-financial targets in \\nthe past financial year (vesting year). \\nPayment of the personal cash investment amount is made after \\nthe Annual General Meeting at which the Financial Statements \\nare presented for the relevant financial year. The shares of com-\\nmon stock are purchased immediately after the personal cash in-\\nvestment amount has been paid out and are subject to a holding \\nperiod of four years from the date of purchase. The RoCE com-\\nponent and the strategic focus target component each make up \\nhalf of the target amount for the personal cash investment \\namount. For the RoCE component, a RoCE factor is determined \\nbased on the RoCE achieved in the Automotive segment for the \\ngrant year. For the strategic focus target component, a minimum \\nof two strategic focus targets are defined prior to the start of the \\nfinancial year. Minimum, target and maximum values are defined \\nand factors are assigned for the RoCE in the Automotive seg-\\nment and for each strategic focus target. The relevant factors are \\ndetermined after the end of the financial year based on the extent \\nto which targets were achieved. \\nFor financial years up to and including financial year 2020, \\nBoard of Management members received an earmarked cash \\namount (investment component) corresponding to 45% of the \\ngross amount of the bonus that, net of tax and deductions, had \\nto be invested in shares of the Company’s common stock (up to \\nand including financial year 2017, the investment component \\namounted to 20% of the total bonus after tax, which the Board \\nof Management members received plus tax and social security \\nas additional cash remuneration). This amount was also subject \\nto a four-year holding period and on expiry thereof the Board of \\nManagement members received one additional share of the \\nCompany’s common stock or the equivalent value in cash \\n(matching component) for every three shares of common stock \\nheld, at BMW AG’s discretion. \\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for early \\npayment of share-based remuneration components (matching \\ncomponents) based on the target amounts, and the holding pe-\\nriod is also dropped for shares of common stock that were ac-\\nquired with share -based remuneration components. Where the \\nservice contract is terminated prematurely and the Company has \\nan extraordinary right of termination, or if the Board member re-\\nsigns without the Company’s agreement, entitlements to \\namounts as yet unpaid relating to share -based remuneration \\n(matching components) are forfeited; a personal cash invest-\\nment amount will be settled based on the target amount.  \\nUp to and including financial year 2021, eligible senior depart-\\nment heads committed to invest 26% of their earnings-related \\nbonus in shares of BMW AG common stock and to hold the ac-\\nquired shares for four years. For the investment obligation, BMW \\nAG granted an amount corresponding to the entire investment \\namount as a net subsidy. \\nParticipants receive one additional share of common stock or the \\nequivalent value in cash for every three shares of common stock \\nheld once the four-year holding requirement has been fulfilled, at \\nthe Company’s discretion. \\nThe Board of Management members in office on the balance \\nsheet date hold 112,969 shares of BMW common stock with a \\nholding obligation arising from share-based remuneration for fi-\\nnancial years 2019 to 2022 (2022: 118,604).

The segmentation follows the internal \\nmanagement and reporting system and takes account of the or-\\nganisational structure of the BMW Group based on the various \\nproducts and services of the reportable segments. \\nThe activities of the BMW Group are broken down into the oper-\\nating segments Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services and \\nOther Entities. \\nWithin the Automotive segment, the BMW Group develops, man-\\nufactures, assembles and sells automobiles powered with all-\\nelectric drive systems, plug-in hybrid systems and highly efficient \\ncombustion engines, as well as spare parts, accessories and mo-\\nbility services under the BMW, MINI and Rolls- Royce brands. \\nBMW and MINI brand products are sold in Germany through \\nbranches of BMW AG and by independent, authorised dealer-\\nships. Sales outside Germany are handled mainly by subsidiary \\ncompanies and by independent import companies in some mar-\\nkets. Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are sold in selected markets via \\nsubsidiary companies and elsewhere by independent, authorised \\ndealerships. \\nActivities relating to the development, manufacture, assembly \\nand sale of motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories \\nare reported in the Motorcycles segment. \\nAutomobile and motorcycle leasing, retail and dealership financ-\\ning, multi-brand fleet business, customer deposit business and \\ninsurance activities are the main activities allocated to the Finan-\\ncial Services segment. \\nHolding and Group financing companies are reported in the Other \\nEntities segment. This segment also includes the operating com-\\npany Bavaria Lloyd Reisebüro GmbH, which is not allocated to \\none of the other segments. \\nInternal management and reporting \\nSegment information is prepared as a general rule in conformity \\nwith the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting \\nthe Group Financial Statements. Exceptions to this general prin-\\nciple include the treatment of inter-segment warranties, the earn-\\nings impact of which is allocated to the respective segments on \\nthe basis used internally to manage the business. In addition, in-\\ntragroup repurchase agreements between the Automotive and \\nFinancial Services segments pursuant to IFRS 15, impairment al-\\nlowances on intragroup receivables and changes in the value of \\nconsolidated other investments pursuant to IFRS 9 are also ex-\\ncluded. Intragroup leasing arrangements are not reflected in the \\ninternal management and reporting system on an IFRS 16 basis \\nand therefore, in accordance with IFRS 8, do not give rise to any \\nchanges in the presentation of segment information. Inter-seg-\\nment receivables and payables, provisions, income, expenses \\nand profits are eliminated upon consolidation. Inter-segment rev-\\nenues are based on market prices. Centralised cost components \\nare included in the respective segments, without resulting in cash \\nflows. \\nThe role of “chief operating decision maker” with respect to re-\\nsource allocation and performance assessment of the reportable \\nsegment is embodied in the full Board of Management. For this \\npurpose, different measures of segment performance as well as \\nsegment assets are taken into account in the operating \\nsegments. \\nThe Automotive and Motorcycles segments are managed on the \\nbasis of return on capital employed (RoCE). The relevant meas-\\nure of segment results used is therefore profit before financial re-\\nsult. Capital employed is the corresponding measure of segment \\nassets used to determine how to allocate resources. Capital em-\\nployed is calculated as the sum of intangible assets, property, \\nplant and equipment and net working capital, the latter compris-\\ning inventories as well as trade receivables less trade payables.  \\nFurther information is provided in the section “Managing oper -\\national performance at segment level” within the Combined Man-\\nagement Report. \\nThe success of the Financial Services segment is measured on \\nthe basis of return on equity (RoE). Profit before tax therefore rep-\\nresents the relevant measure of segment earnings. The measure \\nof segment assets in the Financial Services segment corresponds \\nto net assets, defined as total assets less total liabilities. \\nThe success of the Other Entities segment is assessed on the \\nbasis of profit or loss before tax. The corresp onding measure of \\nsegment assets used to manage the Other Entities segment is \\ntotal assets less asset -side income tax items and intragroup \\ninvestments.'),\n",

These matters were addressed in the \\ncontext of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as \\na whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not \\nprovide a separate audit opinion on these matters. \\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as \\nfollows: \\n1/ Measurement of leased products \\n2/ Valuation of receivables from sales financing \\n3/ Valuation of provisions for statutory and non -statutory \\nwarranty obligations as well as product guarantees \\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured \\nin each case as follows: \\n1/ Matter and issue  \\n2/ Audit approach and findings \\n3/ Reference to further information \\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters: \\n1/ Measurement of leased products \\n1/ The BMW Group leases vehicles to end customers under op-\\nerating leases (leased products). At the balance sheet date, the \\nfigure reported under the \"leased products\" line item for operat-\\ning leases was EUR 43,118 million (approximately 17.2% of \\ntotal assets). Leased products are measured at cost, which is \\ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to the \\nexpected residual value (recoverable amount). A key estimated \\nvalue for subsequent measurement of leased products is the \\nexpected residual value at the end of the lease term. For the re-\\nsidual value forecasts the BMW Group uses internally available \\ndata on historical empirical values, current market data and \\nmarket estimates as well as forecasts by external market re-\\nsearch institutes. The residual value estimates also contain reg-\\nulatory changes in the individual markets and expectations re-\\ngarding customer behavior, among others including climate pol-\\nicy considerations. The estimation of future residual values is \\nsubject to judgment due to the large number of assumptions to \\nbe made by the executive directors and the amount of data in-\\ncluded in the determination. \\nAgainst this background and due to the resulting significant un-\\ncertainties with regard to estimates in the context of measuring \\nthe residual values of the leased products, this matter was of \\nparticular significance in the context of our audit. \\n2/ As part of our audit we obtained an understanding of the de-\\nvelopment of operating leases, the underlying residual value \\nrisks as well as the business processes for the identification, \\nmanagement, monitoring and measurement of residual value \\nrisks, among other things by inquiries and inspection of docu-\\nments related to the internal calculation methods. Furthermore, \\nwe evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the in-\\nternal control system, particularly regarding the determination of \\nexpected residual values. This included the evaluation of the \\npropriety of the relevant IT systems as well as the implemented \\ninterfaces therein by our IT-specialists. In addition, we evaluated \\nthe appropriateness of the forecasting methods, the model as-\\nsumptions as well as the parameters used for the measurement \\nof the residual values based on the validations carried out by the \\nBMW Group. For this purpose, we inquired with the BMW \\nGroup\\'s experts responsible for the management and monitor-\\ning of residual value risks and inspected the internal analysis on \\nresidual value developments and residual value forecasts as \\nwell as the validation results. We examined the mathematical \\ncorrectness of the forecast values using the key calculation \\nsteps. \\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy our-\\nselves that the methods and processes for determining the ex-\\npected residual values of leased products underlying the \\nvaluation are appropriate and the assumptions and parameters \\nincluded in the forecast model for the residual value are appro-\\npriate as a whole. \\n3/ The Company\\'s disclosures on the applied \"Accounting poli-\\ncies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\" are contained in \\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 \\nand on leased products are contained under note 23. \\n2/ Valuation of receivables from sales financing \\n1/ The BMW Group offers end customers, dealerships and im-\\nporters various  financing models for vehicles. In this context, \\ncurrent and non-current receivables from sales financing total-\\ning EUR 87,355 million are reported in the consolidated state-\\nment of financial position as at the balance sheet date (approx-\\nimately 34.8% of total assets). Impairment losses amounting to \\nEUR 2,189 million were recognized on these receivables as at \\nthe balance sheet date. In order to determine the amount of the \\nnecessary valuation allowances to be recognized with respect \\nto receivables from sales financing, the BMW Group, among \\nothers, evaluates the creditworthiness of the dealers, importers \\nand end customers, as well as any loss ratios, and risk provi-\\nsioning parameters are derived based on historical default prob-\\nabilities and loss ratios. \\nThe determination of the valuation allowances by the executive \\ndirectors is subject to a significant degree of judgment due to \\nseveral value-influencing factors such as the estimation of cre-\\nditworthiness, the determination of probabilities of default and \\nloss ratios and was therefore of particular significance in the \\ncontext of our audit. \\n2/ As part of our audit we obtained a comprehensive under-\\nstanding of the development of receivables from sales financing, \\nthe associated default-related risks as well as the business pro-\\ncesses for the identification, management, monitoring and \\nmeasurement of default risks, among other things by inquiries \\nand inspection of documents on the internal calculation meth-\\nods. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effec-\\ntiveness of the internal control system regarding the determina-\\ntion of the impairment loss to be recognized. In this context, we '),\n",

As part of our au-\\ndit we assessed in particular the appropriateness of the risk \\nclassification procedures as well as the risk provisioning param-\\neters used. For this purpose, we analyzed in particular the vali-\\ndations of parameters that are regularly conducted by the Com-\\npany. To assess the default risk, we also used targeted sam-\\npling of individual cases to examine whether the attributes for \\nassignment to the respective risk categories were suitably avail-\\nable and the impairment losses had been calculated using the \\nparameters defined for these risk categories. \\nIn our view, the assumptions and parameters used in the meas-\\nurement of receivables from sales financing were appropriate \\noverall. \\n3/ The Company\\'s disclosures on the applied \"Accounting poli-\\ncies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\" are contained in \\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 \\nand on \"receivables from sales financing\" are contained under \\nnote 25. \\n3/ Valuation of provisions for statutory and non -statutory \\nwarranty obligations as well as product guarantees \\n1/ Provisions for statutory and non -statutory warranty obliga-\\ntions as well as product guarantees are included in the consoli-\\ndated financial statements of BMW Group as a material amount \\nin other provisions. The obligations amounted to EUR 9,650 \\nmillion (approximately 3.8% of total assets) as at 31 December \\n2023. The BMW Group is responsible for the legally required \\nwarranty and product guarantees in the respective sales market. \\nIn order to estimate the liabilities arising from statutory and non-\\nstatutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees for \\nvehicles sold, information on the type and volume of damages \\narising and on remedial measures is recorded and analyzed at \\nvehicle model level. The expected amount of obligations is ex-\\ntrapolated from costs of the past and recognized as a provision \\nin the corresponding amount, if the criteria of IAS 37 have been \\nmet. For specific or anticipated individual circumstances, for ex-\\nample recalls for vehicles sold, additional provisions are recog-\\nnized provided they have not already been taken into account.  \\nThe determination of provisions is associated with unavoidable \\nestimation uncertainties and is subject to a high risk of change, \\ndepending on factors such as notification of detected defects as \\nwell as claims made by vehicle owners. Against this background, \\nthis matter was of particular significance during our audit. \\n2/ In order to assess the appropriateness of the valuation \\nmethod used for the determination of the provisions for statu-\\ntory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product \\nguarantees including the assumptions and parameters, we pri-\\nmarily obtained an understanding of the process for determining \\nthe assumptions and parameters through discussions with the \\nresponsible employees of the BMW Group. We also evaluated \\nthe appropriateness as well as effectiveness of controls for de-\\ntermining the assumptions and parameters. With the involve-\\nment of our IT specialists, we checked the IT systems used re-\\ngarding their compliance. We compared the expenses for claims \\nand technical actions with actual costs incurred in order to draw \\nconclusions on the forecast accuracy. Based on a targeted sam-\\nple of vehicle models, the mathematical correctness of the valu-\\nation model used across the Group was examined. We exam-\\nined and evaluated the assumptions used by the BMW Group \\nconcerning the extent to which the past values were representa-\\ntive of the expected susceptibility of damage, the expected value \\nof damage per vehicle (comprising parts and labor input) as well \\nas the expected assertion of claims from statutory and non-stat-\\nutory warranties. \\nIn our view, the method for the valuation of provisions for statu-\\ntory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product \\nguarantees is overall appropriate. Taking into consideration the \\ninformation available, we believe that, overall, the measurement \\nparameters and assumptions used by the executive directors \\nare appropriate. \\n3/ The Company\\'s disclosures on the applied \"Accounting poli-\\ncies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\" are contained in \\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 \\nand on \"Other provisions\" are contained under note 34. \\nOther Information \\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other infor-\\nmation. The other information comprises the following non-au-\\ndited parts of the group management report: \\n— the section \"APPROPRIATENESS AND EFFECTIVENESS \\nOF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AND RISK \\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\" of the group management \\nreport \\n— the disclosures marked with \\u200a[[\\u200a    ]] of the non -financial \\nstatement to comply with §§ 289b to 289e HGB  and with \\n§§ 315b to 315c HGB\\nThe other information comprises further \\n— the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f \\nHGB and § 315d HGB \\n— the remuneration report pursuant to §  162 AktG [Aktien -\\ngesetz: German Stock Corporation Act], for which the \\nsupervisory board is also responsible \\n— all remaining parts of the annual report – excluding cross-\\nreferences to external information – with the exception of \\nthe audited consolidated financial statements, the audited \\ngroup management report and our auditor\\'s report \\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and \\non the group management report do not cover the other infor-\\nmation, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or \\nany other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In addition the executive directors are re-\\nsponsible for such internal control as they have determined nec-\\nessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial state-\\nments that are free from material misstatement, whether due to \\nfraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of \\nassets) or error.  \\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the execu-\\ntive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to \\ncontinue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility \\nfor disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In \\naddition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on \\nthe going concern basis of accounting unless there is an inten-\\ntion to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no \\nrealistic alternative but to do so. \\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the \\npreparation of the group management report that, as a whole, \\nprovides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in \\nall material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial \\nstatements, complies with German legal requirements, and \\nappropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future de-\\nvelopment. In addition, the executive directors are responsible \\nfor such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have \\nconsidered necessary to enable the preparation of a group man-\\nagement report that is in accordance with the applicable Ger-\\nman legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient ap-\\npropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management \\nreport. \\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's \\nfinancial reporting process for the preparation of the consoli-\\ndated financial statements and of the group management re-\\nport. \\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements and of the Group Management Report \\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are \\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, \\nand whether the group management report as a whole provides \\nan appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material \\nrespects, is consistent with the consolidated financial state-\\nments and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with \\nthe German legal requirements and appropriately presents the \\nopportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue \\nan auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the con-\\nsolidated financial statements and on the group management \\nreport. \\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \\nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 \\nHGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with Ger-\\nman Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Au-\\ndits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will \\nalways detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can \\narise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individ-\\nually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of \\nthese consolidated financial statements and this group man-\\nagement report. \\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional \\nskepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of \\nthe consolidated financial statements and of the group \\nmanagement report, whether due to fraud or error, design \\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, \\nand obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate \\nto provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not \\ndetecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is \\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.  \\n— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the \\naudit of the consolidated financial statements and of \\narrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the \\naudit of the group management report in order to design \\naudit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, \\nbut not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on \\nthe effectiveness of these systems. \\n— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nby the executive directors and the reasonableness of \\nestimates made by the executive directors and related \\ndisclosures. \\n— Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' \\nuse of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on \\nthe audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty \\nexists related to events or conditions that may cast \\nsignificant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a \\ngoing concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty \\nexists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's \\nreport to the related disclosures in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements and in the group management report \\nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our \\nrespective audit opinions.

On the basis of sufficient appropriate \\naudit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant \\nassumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for \\nthe prospective information and evaluate the proper \\nderivation of the prospective information from these \\nassumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion \\non the prospective information and on the assumptions \\nused as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that \\nfuture events will differ materially from the prospective \\ninformation. \\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regard-\\ning, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the \\naudit and significant audit findings, including any significant de-\\nficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. \\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a state-\\nment that we have complied with the relevant independence re-\\nquirements, and communicate with them all relationships and \\nother matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate \\nthreats or safeguards applied. \\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with gov-\\nernance, we determine those matters that were of most signifi-\\ncance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the \\ncurrent period and are therefore the key audit matters.

REVIEW OF THE 2023 FINANCIAL YEAR\\nFROM A REMUNERATION PERSPECTIVE\\nThe 2023 financial year was very successful for the BMW Group. \\nA total of 2,554,183 vehicles were delivered – a new record for \\nthe BMW Group. The BMW brand defended its leading position \\nin the global premium segment by selling just under 2.3 million \\ndelivered vehicles. The Rolls-Royce brand also achieved record \\nsales. BMW Motorrad achieved the strongest sales in the Com-\\npany’s history in the year of its 100th anniversary. \\n1 For reasons of simplicity, this report partially uses the masculine form in reference to persons.

Outlook for the 2024 Financial Year\\nThe BMW Group generated a strong profit in the 2023 financial \\nyear. Group net profit amounted to € 12.2 billion, with € 11.3 bil-\\nlion attributable to BMW AG shareholders, while the Group return \\non sales after tax amounted to 7.8%. Under the leadership of the \\nBoard of Management, the Company continued to drive the \\nBMW Group’s transformation to electromobility forward in the re-\\nporting year. The BMW Group increased its sales of all -electric \\nve-hicles at a significantly greater pace than the market as a \\nwhole and has an all- electric offering in every major segment. \\nThe proportion of total sales attributable to all -electric vehicles \\nwent up to around 15%. \\nThe current remuneration system for the members of the Board \\nof Management came into effect on 1 January 2021. The Annual \\nGeneral Meeting approved it on 12 May 2021 with a majority of \\n91.60% of the valid votes cast. The Supervisory Board did not \\nresolve any changes to the remuneration system or the target \\nremuneration in the remuneration levels set out for the members \\nof the Board of Management in the 2023 financial year. \\nIn December 2022, the Supervisory Board set ambitious targets \\nlinked to the variable remuneration of the members of the Board \\nof Management for the 2023 financial year. Of the total variable \\ntarget remuneration available, around 39% was linked to envi-\\nronmental, social or governance (ESG) targets. The Supervisory \\nBoard has set ambitious targets to reduce fleet carbon emissions \\nin the EU and to increase all-electric vehicle sales. These serve \\nas strategic focus targets that correspond to 50% of the long -\\nterm variable remuneration (share -based remuneration). The \\nSupervisory Board has thus once again incorporated the strate-\\ngic importance of accelerating the electrification of the vehicle \\nfleet into the remuneration for the members of the Board of Man-\\nagement. The Supervisory Board placed particular emphasis on \\nenvironmental sustainability targets, which make up 50% of the \\nlong-term variable remuneration. \\nThanks to its strong overall performance, the Board of Manage-\\nment exceeded both the financial and a large part of the non-\\nfinancial targets for short-term variable remuneration (bonuses) \\nfor the 2023 financial year. ↗ Bonus for the 2023 financial year The fi-\\nnancial target tied to RoCE in the Automotive segment which \\nmakes up part of the long- term variable remuneration (share -\\nbased remuneration) component was also exceeded. In terms of \\nthe non-financial strategic focus targets for the long -term vari-\\nable remuneration, the ambitious targets related to the reduction \\nof fleet carbon emissions in the EU were exceeded, while the \\nBMW Group’s sales targets for all-electric vehicles were not quite \\nmet in full. ↗ Share-based remuneration for the financial year 2023 \\nIf necessary, and in the interest of the long -term success of \\nBMW\\u2006AG, the Supervisory Board may temporarily deviate from \\nthe remuneration system – as provided for in §\\u200987a (2) Sentence \\n2 AktG. In accordance with G.11 of the German Corporate Gov-\\nernance Code dated 28 April 2022 (“GCGC”), the Supervisory \\nBoard has also reserved the right to make adjustments if extraor-\\ndinary developments occur, such as significant acquisitions and \\ndisposals, or changes in accounting standards or tax regulations \\nthat have a significant impact. After due examination, it did not \\nmake use of these options for the 2023 financial year. \\nThe composition of the Board of Management changed during \\nthe 2023 financial year. Mr Pieter Nota left the Board of Man-\\nagement on 31 October 2023 by mutual agreement as part of a \\nsuccession arrangement. Dr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Man-\\nagement on 11 May 2023. This was also by mutual agreement \\nas part of a succession arrangement.  ↗ Premature termination of \\nactivities and post-contractual non-competition clause Mr Walter Mertl was \\nappointed as the member of the Board of Management respon-\\nsible for Finance on 12 May 2023. Mr Jochen Goller was ap-\\npointed as the member of the Board of Management responsible \\nfor Customer, Brands, Sales on 1 November 2023. From the \\nstart date of his second period of office on 1 July 2023, Mr Frank \\nWeber was eligible to receive the target remuneration in the sec-\\nond remuneration level, which is available to members of the \\nBoard of Management from their second period of office. \\nThe remuneration system for the members of the Supervisory \\nBoard is set out in Article 16 of the Articles of Incorporation and \\nprovides only for fixed remuneration. It was confirmed by the An-\\nnual General Meeting on 12 May 2021 with a majority of \\n99.40% of the valid votes cast, and implemented for the 2023 \\nfinancial year in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of \\nIncorporation. In the 2023 financial year, Dr Martin Kimmich was \\nappointed by the court to replace Mr Manfred Schoch as a mem-\\nber of the Supervisory Board on 18 January 2023. Mr Schoch left \\nthe Supervisory Board on 31 December 2022. On 23 January \\n2023, Dr Kimmich was appointed as the first deputy chair by the \\nSupervisory Board and as a member of the Personnel and Audit \\nCommittee. As the first deputy chair, he is also a member of the \\nPresiding Board and the legally required Mediation Committee. \\nApart from this, the composition of the Personnel Committee, \\nwhich is responsible for the preparation of remuneration deci-\\nsions in accordance with the Supervisory Board’s rules of proce-\\ndure, did not change in the 2023 financial year. The Supervisory \\nBoard awarded a contract to new external remuneration consult-\\nants in the 2023 financial year. The Remuneration Report for the \\n2022 financial year was confirmed by the Annual General Meet-\\ning on 11 May 2023 with a majority of 94.14% of the valid votes \\ncast. In view of the high level of approval, there was no reason to \\nrethink the implementation of the current remuneration system \\nor the manner of reporting. Changes were made to make certain \\nissues clearer. \\nII. OUTLOOK FOR THE\\n2024 FINANCIAL YEAR\\nThe remuneration system and the target remuneration for the \\nremuneration levels of  the members of the Board of Manage-\\nment, as described in this report for the 2023 financial year, will \\ncontinue to apply unchanged in the 2024 financial year. In De-\\ncember 2023, the Supervisory Board set the targets for variable \\nremuneration for the 2024 financial year on the basis of a pro-\\nposal by the Personnel Committee. A resolution was passed to \\nraise the required level of performance for the earnings compo-\\nnent of the bonus for the Board of Management, which remains \\nlimited to 180% of the target remuneration.  \\nThere are no plans to change the remuneration system for mem-\\nbers of the Supervisory Board for the 2024 financial year.

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management \\nIII. REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS\\nOF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\\n1. Principles of the remuneration system and the contribution of \\nremuneration to the promotion of the Company’s business \\nstrategy and its long-term development \\nThe remuneration system which has been in place since the \\n2021 financial year complies with the pro visions of the German \\nStock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations and \\nsuggestions of the GCGC. The Supervisory Board has applied the \\nfollowing principles in designing the remuneration system for the \\nBoard of Management: \\n— The remuneration structure is geared towards the \\nsustainable and long -term development of the Company. \\nTherefore, variable remuneration components are pre -\\ndominantly granted on the basis of a multi-year \\nassessment. \\n— The total remuneration of the members of the Board of \\nManagement is commensurate with their tasks and \\nperformance as well as the Company’s situation. \\n— The remuneration system ensures that both positive and \\nnegative developments are appropriately reflected in the \\nremuneration (“pay for performance”). \\n— The remuneration system takes into account both the \\nperformance of the entire Board of Management and the \\nachievement of individual targets. \\n— The remuneration system observes the principle of \\nconsistency between the remuneration systems in the \\nCompany: the remuneration systems for the Board of \\nManagement, executives and employees of BMW AG are all \\ndesigned in a similar way. \\n— The total remuneration is in line with market practice both in \\nterms of amount and structure, and takes into account the \\nsize, complexity and economic situation of the Company. \\nThe BMW\\u202fGroup aims to be the most successful and sustainable \\npremium provider of individual mobility. The business strategy \\nfocuses on the customer and the provision of sustainable individ-\\nual mobility in the premium segment, taking into account high \\nprofitability, in order to secure the Company’s independence in \\nthe future. The remuneration system contributes to the imple-\\nmentation of the business strategy and the sustainable and long-\\nterm development of the Company. It also takes into account the \\nconcerns of the Company’s important stakeholders (in particular, \\nshareholders, customers and employees). The incentive effects \\nof the various remuneration components have a complementary \\neffect. \\n— The fixed basic remuneration counteracts the temptation to \\ntake disproportionately high risks in order to achieve short -\\nterm goals, and thus contributes to the long -term \\ndevelopment of the Company. It ensures a minimum income \\nappropriate to the tasks and responsibilities of a member of \\nthe Board of Management.  \\n— The variable bonus is divided into two parts, which influence \\nbehaviour in different ways. The earnings-related \\ncomponent of the bonus rewards recipients for achieving \\nthe Company’s financial targets in the vesting year, and \\npromotes the earnings-related parts of the business \\nstrategy. In contrast, the performance component of the \\nbonus is based on non-financial performance criteria, which \\nare also derived from the business strategy. In this respect, \\nthe performance component of the bonus also offers \\nparticular incentives to encourage individuals to pursue the \\ngoals of the business strategy consistently for the long-term \\ndevelopment of the Company. These goals do not have to \\nbe directly reflected in the key financial indicators for a given \\nvesting year. \\n— The amount of the variable share-based remuneration also \\ndepends on the fulfilment of financial and non -financial \\nobjectives derived from the business strategy, since 50% of \\nthe target personal cash investment amount earmarked for \\nshare purchases is linked to a financial key indicator (RoCE \\nin the Automotive segment), and 50% is linked to strategic \\nfocus targets. The obligation to use the total net amount to \\npurchase shares of common stock in the Company and to \\nhold these shares for at least four years is a share ownership \\nguideline that strengthens the entrepreneurial long -term \\norientation of the Board of Management. Implementing the \\ncorporate strategy sustainably by taking appropriate \\ndecisions also creates lasting value for the shareholders, \\nand thus regularly provides the basis for positive long -term \\ncapital market performance. Due to the substantial \\ninvestment and the fixed holding period associated with \\nthese shares, members of the Board of Management \\nparticipate in the long- term positive (and negative)  \\ndevelopment of the Company, as reflected in the share price \\nand dividend trends.

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management  \\n \\n \\n3. Determination and review of the remuneration system and  \\nindividual remuneration \\nDetermining the system and structure of Board of Management \\nremuneration, and reviewing it regularly, is a task of the full Su-\\npervisory Board, as is determining the individual level of remu-\\nneration of members of the Board of Management. The Person-\\nnel Committee of the Supervisory Board assumes a preparatory \\nfunction. \\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration system annu-\\nally to ensure it is appropriate in terms of structure, target and \\nmaximum remuneration, as well as actual remuneration. The Su-\\npervisory Board also takes remuneration studies into account \\nwhen assessing the market conformity of the target and maxi-\\nmum remuneration, as well as when assessing actual remuner-\\nation in horizontal terms. Due to the size and structure of the \\nBMW Group, DAX companies are used as a comparison group \\nwhile taking revenues, employee headcounts and market capi-\\ntalisation into consideration. This ensures that the main compet-\\nitors of BMW AG and other global companies are factored in. Ver-\\ntically, the Supervisory Board compares the remuneration of \\nmembers of the Board of Management with the remuneration of \\nsenior executives and with the average remuneration of employ-\\nees employed by BMW\\u2006AG in Germany in areas inside and out-\\nside the scope of collective bargaining agreements, including in \\nterms of how they have changed over a period of several years. \\nRecommendations from independent external remuneration ex-\\nperts, as well as suggestions from investor and analyst circles, \\nmay also be included in the deliberations. For the 2023 financial \\nyear, the review has shown that the target, maximum and actual \\nremuneration are appropriate. \\nIn accordance with the remuneration system, the Supervisory \\nBoard – acting on the proposal of the Personnel Committee – \\nsets specific target remuneration for each individual member of \\nthe Board of Management for the upcoming financial year, as \\nwell as the performance criteria associated with the variable re-\\nmuneration components provided for in the remuneration  \\nsystem. \\nThe total target remuneration is composed of the fixed remuner-\\nation and the variable remuneration. Within the variable target \\nremuneration, the proportion of share-based remuneration as \\nlong-term variable remuneration exceeds the share of the bonus \\nas short-term variable remuneration. The share of the individual \\nremuneration components is within the ranges specified by the \\nremuneration system. \\nOverview of total target remuneration for members of the \\nBoard of Management1 \\n \\n1 The remuneration structure as defined in the remuneration system for total target remuneration is \\ndepicted. \\n2 Excluding a possible payment to new members of the Board of Management to compensate for \\nsalary losses from a previous employment relationship and/or to cover relocation costs.  \\nTarget remuneration for the 2023 financial year \\nThe following tables show the individual target remuneration of \\nthe members of the Board of Management and the relative share \\nof the respective remuneration component in the total target re-\\nmuneration.

If 100% of the target is achieved for both the \\nperformance and the earnings component, the share of the  \\nbonus attached to each component is 50% of the individual tar-\\nget amount of the bonus.

For this pur-\\npose, the Supervisory Board adopted an allocation matrix, from \\nwhich an earnings factor is derived based on the values \\nachieved. \\nA minimum value, a target value and a maximum value were de-\\nfined for both key figures before the start of the 2023 vesting \\nyear. If one of the minimum values is not reached, the earnings \\nfactor is zero (corresponding to a target achievement of 0%). If \\nboth target values are reached, the earnings factor is 1.000 (cor-\\nresponding to a target achievement of 100%). If both maximum \\nvalues are exceeded, the earnings factor is 1.800 (correspond-\\ning to a target achievement of 180%, the highest possible per-\\ncentage).

In the 2023 financial year, BMW  AG’s \\nshare of profit attributable to shareholders was €  11.3 billion, \\nand the Group post-tax return on sales was 7.8%.

Before the beginning of the \\nfinancial year, the Supervisory Board sets these targets in the \\nform of various non-financial performance criteria and associ-\\nated metrics. The performance criteria are derived primarily from \\nthe corporate strategy, long-term corporate planning and the \\nbusiness development planning done for the following year. The \\ntargets are divided into individual targets for the individual mem-\\nbers of the Board of Management (departmental targets) and \\ncollective targets for the entire Board of Management (interde-\\npartmental targets). The Supervisory Board has discretion in \\nweighting the performance criteria. Approximately 10% of the \\ntarget amount for the performance bonus is intended to be allo-\\ncated to the departmental targets. Departmental targets can be \\ndepartment-specific targets or contributions to shared targets \\nmeasured individually for each department. The remainder of the \\ntarget amount for the performance bonus (amounting to approx-\\nimately 90%) should be associated with interdepartmental, non-\\nfinancial targets.

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management  \\n \\n \\nTargets set and extent of achievement – performance component of \\nthe bonus for the 2023 financial year \\nThe targets set by the Supervisory Board for the 2023 vesting \\nyear as part of the performance component of the bonus, the \\nweighting of the relevant criteria and the individual target \\nachievement are summarised in the tables below. \\nThe Supervisory Board assessed the performance of the mem-\\nbers of the Board of Management in terms of the departmental \\ntargets, on the one hand, and the interdepartmental targets, on \\nthe other hand, within a target achievement corridor with a partial \\nperformance factor between 0 (corresponding to a target being \\n0% achieved) and 1.80 (corresponding to a target being 180% \\nachieved, the highest possible percentage). The performance \\nfactor for the bonus was determined from the partial perfor-\\nmance factors, with a weighting of 10% for the departmental tar-\\ngets and 90% for the interdepartmental targets, in each case in \\nrelation to the target amount of the performance component of \\nthe bonus. With regard to the interdepartmental targets, 50% of \\nthe weighting is for non-financial environmental, social and gov-\\nernance (ESG) targets, and 40% is for other non -financial tar-\\ngets, in each case in relation to the target amount of the perfor-\\nmance component of the bonus. \\nThe leadership performance of the individual members of the \\nBoard of Management was assessed along with the overall per-\\nformance of the Board of Management as a whole. With regard \\nto the departmental targets, the Supervisory Board assessed the \\nindividual performance of each member of the Board of Manage-\\nment. With regard to the interdepartmental targets, the Supervi-\\nsory Board considered the Board of Management as a team and \\nassessed the performance of all the members of the Board of \\nManagement as a whole. The Supervisory Board’s decision -\\nmaking process is based on a detailed, documented analysis of \\nperformance as measured against all the agreed criteria, as well \\nas in-depth discussions at Personnel Committee and full Super-\\nvisory Board level. As a basis for the targets set in the previous \\nyear and the assessment process following the financial year, the \\nSupervisory Board was guided, in particular, by the quantitative \\nand qualitative metrics that were defined in the corporate plan-\\nning before the beginning of the financial year. \\nThe results of comparative studies and calculations vis -à-vis \\ncompetitors were also used to assess individual metrics. In addi-\\ntion to a review of performan ce in 2023, the Supervisory Board \\ncarried out a trend review covering several financial years. In do-\\ning so, it assessed the effects of decisions, measures and the \\noverall course set in previous financial years on the 2023 finan-\\ncial year and also estimated the significance of the performance \\nin 2023 for the future development of the Company. \\nThe defined quantitative and qualitative metrics include indica-\\ntors such as vehicle sales, segment shares, the share of sales for \\nelectrified and all-electric vehicles and the share of BMW brand \\nvehicles with remote software upgrade capability. Other metrics \\nincluded assessments of the quality of the customer experience \\ncompared to the competition, the R&D ratio, spending on em-\\nployee training and development and diversity targets.  \\nOverview of targets of the performance component of the \\nbonus for the financial year 20231 \\n \\n1 Based on the target amount of the performance component of the bonus. \\n2 Individual assessment for each member of the Board of Management. \\n3 Collective assessment of the Board of Management as a team.\\n10%\\nDepartmental \\ntargets²\\n50%\\nInterdepartmental \\nESG targets³\\n40%\\nOther \\ninterdepartmental \\nnon-financial targets³'),\n",

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management  \\n \\n \\n(2) Share-based remuneration for the 2023 financial year \\nAs part of the share-based remuneration as a variable long-term \\ncomponent of remuneration, the members of the Board of Man-\\nagement receive a cash payment earmarked for investment in \\nBMW shares of common stock (the “personal cash investment \\namount”). This amount depends on the achievement of certain \\nfinancial and non-financial targets in the past financial year (vest-\\ning year). The members of the Board of Management are obliged \\nto invest their personal cash investment amounts (less taxes and \\nduties) in BMW shares of common stock immediately after dis-\\nbursement, and to hold these shares for a period of at least four \\nyears (share ownership guideline). The holding period remains in \\neffect even if the member leaves the Board of Management. \\nPersonal cash investment amount \\nThe personal cash investment amount for the 2023 financial \\nyear will be paid as part of the next payroll run after the Annual \\nGeneral Meeting in 2024. The size of this amount depends on \\nthe target amount, the RoCE achieved in the Automotive seg-\\nment and the degree to which certain strategic focus targets \\nwere achieved in the vesting year. The personal cash investment \\namount is limited to a maximum of 180% of the target amount \\nand is calculated as follows: \\nPersonal cash investment amount = \\nRoCE component + strategic focus target component \\nOverview of share-based remuneration1 \\n \\n1 Simplified depiction. \\n2 At least two strategic focus targets and their proportion of the target amount are determined by the Supervisory Board. \\n3 Exemplary illustration of price development. \\n4 Payment of the personal cash investment amount, acquisition of shares and the start of the four-year holding period occur as part of the next payroll run after the Annual General Meeting at which the \\nannual financial statements for the vesting year are presented. \\n \\nTarget amount for the personal cash investment amount \\nThe target amounts for the individual members of the Board of \\nManagement for the 2023 financial year are presented in the  \\ntable ↗ Overview of share-based remuneration for financial year 2023. \\nRoCE component of the personal cash investment amount \\nBefore the beginning of the relevant vesting year, the Supervi-\\nsory Board sets minimum, target and maximum values for the \\nRoCE in the Automotive segment in the vesting year on the basis \\nof corporate planning, and assigns a RoCE factor to each of these \\nvalues. If the minimum value is not reached, the RoCE factor is 0. \\nIf the target value is reached, the RoCE factor is 1.00. If the max-\\nimum value is reached or exceeded, the RoCE factor is 1.80. The \\nRoCE component of the personal investment cash amount is \\ndetermined by multiplying the RoCE factor for the vesting year by \\n50% of the individual target amount. \\nStrategic focus targets component of the personal cash investment \\namount \\nThe Supervisory Board sets at least two strategic focus targets \\nbefore the start of the vesting year. It derives these targets from \\nthe corporate strategy and corporate planning. It then sets a min-\\nimum, target and maximum value for each strategic focus target, \\nand assigns a factor to each of these values. If the minimum \\nvalue is not reached, the factor for that target is 0. If the target \\nvalue is reached, the factor for that target is 1.00. If the maximum \\nvalue is reached or exceeded, the factor for that target is 1.80. \\nThe strategic focus targets component of the personal cash \\ninvestment amount is determined in a two -step process. In the \\nfirst step, the factor for the vesting year achieved for the relevant \\nstrategic focus target is multiplied by the share of the individual \\ntarget amount attributable to this target. In the second step, the \\nvalues determined for the individual strategic focus targets using \\nthis calculation are added together. If two strategic focus targets \\nare set, each strategic focus target accounts for 25% of the indi-\\nvidual target amount, unless the Supervisory Board decides on a \\ndifferent weighting. If more than two strategic focus targets are \\nset, the Supervisory Board determines the weighting of each  \\ntarget. \\n50% \\nRoCE factor \\nExtent of target achievement for \\nRoCE in the Automotive segment \\n(value between 0 and 1.80) \\nTarget amount \\n50% \\nStrategic focus target factor \\nExtent of target achievement \\nfor strategic focus targets2 \\n(value between 0 and 1.80) \\nTarget amount \\nTaxes and deductions \\nPersonal cash \\ninvestment amount \\n(capped at 180% \\nof the target amount) \\nAmount paid out \\n= \\n= \\nTotal performance period: 5 years \\nFreely  \\navailable \\nshares \\nPerformance period: 4 years \\nPerformance period: 1 year \\nFY n \\n FY n+1 \\n FY n+2 \\n FY n+3 \\n FY n+4 \\n FY n+5 \\nAcquisition of shares4 \\n(amounting to 100% \\nof the payment amount) \\nShare performance over 4 years3 '),\n",

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management \\n6. Retirement benefits \\nThe retirement benefits system provides for the Company to\\nmake annual contributions to a savings account for every year\\nthat members of the Board of Management are appointed. After \\nthey are confirmed, pension entitlements become vested when\\nthe employment relationship has existed for one year. Members\\nof the Board of Management receive a disability pension in the\\nevent of invalidity. Retired members of the Board of Manage-\\nment are entitled to retirement benefits after the age of 62 at the \\nearliest and after leaving the Board. If a member of the Board of\\nManagement dies before becoming entitled to a retirement or in-\\nvalidity benefit, a surviving spouse or registered partner is enti-\\ntled to a survivor’s benefit; otherwise, surviving children are enti-\\ntled to a survivor’s benefit depending on their age and level of\\neducation. The amount of the benefits to be paid is determined\\non the basis of the amount accrued in each Board member’s in-\\ndividual pension savings account. This figure is in turn based on\\nthe annual contributions and annual profit participation depend-\\ning on the form of investment. For the contributions made, there\\nis a guaranteed minimum interest rate equal to the maximum in-\\nterest rates specified in the German actuarial reserve regulation\\n(Deckungsrückstellungsverordnung). The payment is made as a\\nlump sum or in annual instalments at the discretion of the mem-\\nber of the Board of Management. For entitlements arising before \\n2016, there is an option to receive payment as a lifelong monthly \\npension or in a combined form. In the event of death or invalidity, \\na minimum benefit in the amount of the potential annual pension \\ncontributions that could have been made up to the age of 60 is\\napproved.

The rules allow the Supervisory Board to withhold or\\nreclaim variable remuneration in the event of certain serious\\ncompliance-related violations (compliance malus and/or compli-\\nance clawback). These provisions can also be applied where var-\\niable remuneration components linked to the achievement of cer-\\ntain targets have been paid out on the basis of incorrect calcula-\\ntion bases or incorrect financial statements.

Premature termination of activities and \\npost-contractual non-competition clause \\nBoard of Management service contracts provide for severance \\npay to be paid to the Board member in the event of premature \\ntermination by the Company without due cause, the amount of \\nwhich is limited to a maximum of two years’ remuneration (sev-\\nerance payment cap). The member will not be compensated for \\nmore than the remaining term of the service contract. If the re-\\nmaining term of the contract is less than two years, the sever-\\nance payment is reduced proportionately. The annual remuner-\\nation paid generally includes the base salary, the target amount \\nof the bonus and target amount of the personal cash investment \\namount, unless the relevant target amount was not achieved in \\nthe previous year. In this case, the bonus that was actually \\ngranted or the personal cash investment amount that was actu-\\nally disbursed will apply.  \\nThere are no specific severance arrangements covering early \\ntermination of a Board member’s mandate due to a change of \\ncontrol or in connection with a takeover offer. \\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for waiving \\nthe holding period for shares of common stock that were ac-\\nquired with share -based remuneration components.

Entitlements to other \\nvariable remuneration components (bonus, personal cash in-\\nvestment amount) are forfeited as soon as they exceed the target \\namounts.  \\nA one -year post -contractual non-competition clause has been \\nagreed with the Board members under specified circumstances \\nagainst payment of a remuneration amount. Service contracts \\nprovide for the payment of a monthly waiting allowance in the \\namount of the applicable monthly base salary for the duration of \\nthe post-contractual non-competition clause. In accordance with \\nRecommendation G.13 of the GCGC, any severance payment is \\noffset against the waiting allowance. The same applies to other \\nincome from third parties, except remuneration for Supervisory \\nBoard appointments approved during the term of office. The \\nCompany may unilaterally waive the requirement to comply with \\nthe post-contractual non-competition clause.  \\nDr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Management on 11 May 2023 \\nby mutual agreement as part of a succession arrangement. He \\nreceived fixed remuneration (base salary and other remunera-\\ntion) of € 0.05 million for the remaining term of his service con-\\ntract up to 31 May 2023. The bonus and personal investment \\ncash amount for the period between 12 May and 31 May 2023 \\ncame to € 0.08 million and € 0.09 million respectively. A pro rata \\npension contribution of € 0.02 million was made for the period \\nbetween him leaving the Board of Management and the end of \\nhis service contract. A one -year post-contractual non-competi-\\ntion clause applies. The waiting allowance contractually owed to \\nhim amounts to € 1.1 million for the period from 1 June 2023 to \\n31 May 2024 and € 0.6 million for the period from 1 June to 31 \\nDecember 2023. \\nMr Pieter Nota left the Board of Management on 31  October \\n2023 by mutual agreement as part of a succession arrange-\\nment. His service contract comes to an end on 31 July 2024. His \\nremuneration will continue to be paid to him on the contractually \\nagreed due dates until the end of his employment contract; his \\nremuneration will not be settled or paid early; he will not receive \\na termination payment. For the period from 1 November to 31 \\nDecember 2023, he received fixed remuneration (base salary \\nand other remuneration) of € 0.2 million, a bonus of € 0.3 million \\nand a personal cash investment amount of € 0.3 million (all pro \\nrata). The pension contribution comes to € 0.07 million for the \\nperiod from 1 November to 31 December 2023. For the period \\nfrom 1 January to 31 July 2024, his base salary comes to € 0.6 \\nmillion, with a maximum bonus of € 0.7 million and a maximum \\npersonal cash investment amount of € 0.7 million. The pension \\ncontribution for the relevant portion of the 2024 financial year is \\n€ 0.2 million. A one-year post -contractual non -competition \\nclause applies. For the period from 1  August 2024 to 31 July \\n2025, the waiting allowance contractually owed to him amounts \\nto € 1.1 million. \\n9. Remuneration granted and owed to members of the \\nBoard of Management pursuant to § 162 of the German Stock\\nCorporation Act (AktG) \\nThe following tables ↗ Remuneration granted and owed  show the re-\\nmuneration granted and owed to the members of the Board of \\nManagement in office during the reporting year in accordance \\nwith § 162 AktG. The remuneration shown for the members of \\nthe Board of Management who left during the year also includes \\nthe remuneration granted and owed in the reporting year after \\nthey leave the company. \\nThe tables include all amounts received by the individual mem-\\nbers of the Board of Management in the reporting period (“remu-\\nneration granted”) and all remuneration legally due but not yet \\nreceived (“remuneration owed”). \\nIn addition to actual amounts received, “remuneration granted” \\nin the reporting year is also assumed to exist if the activity on \\nwhich the remuneration component is based has been fully per-\\nformed by the member of the Board of Management as of the \\nbalance sheet date, and if all conditions for entitlement have \\nbeen met. \\nThus, in addition to the fixed remuneration components, the fol-\\nlowing variable remuneration components are reported as remu-\\nneration granted for the 2023 financial year within the meaning \\nof §\\u2009162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG): \\n— Bonus for the 2023 financial year (to be paid out in 2024) \\n— Share-based remuneration (personal cash investment \\namount) for the 2023 financial year (to be paid out in 2024) \\n— Share-based remuneration component (matching \\ncomponent) for vesting year 2018, due to the expiry of the \\nfour-year holding period in the 2023 financial year (paid out \\nin 2023) \\nThus, the remuneration granted and owed includes all remuner-\\nation components earned through the activities of the members \\nof the Board of Management in the 2023 financial year. In addi-\\ntion, it includes remuneration components already earned as a \\nresult of activity in previous financial years, but for which the re-\\nspective member of the Board of Management’s payment enti-\\ntlement only arose due to the occurrence of conditions in the \\n2023 financial year. \\nIn addition to the absolute amount of remuneration, the relative \\nshare of the relevant remuneration component in the total remu-\\nneration granted and owed is also shown. For the sake of com-\\npleteness, the individual service cost in accordance with IAS 19 \\nfor the Company pension scheme is also shown, although this \\nservice cost is not classified as granted or owed remuneration \\nwithin the meaning of § 162 AktG.

Remuneration of the Members of the Supervisory Board\\nIV. REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF\\nTHE SUPERVISORY BOARD\\n1. Articles of incorporation and procedure \\nThe regulation governing remuneration for the Su pervisory\\nBoard is set out in § 16 of the Articles of Incorporation, and spec-\\nifies both the remuneration system to be used and the precise\\nframework for calculating the remuneration due to the members\\nof the Supervisory Board. The regulation was adopted by the An-\\nnual General Meeting on 14 May 2020 and confirmed on\\n12 May 2021 with a majority of 99.40% of the valid votes cast.\\n2. Principles and elements of remuneration \\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration is structured as a purely\\nfixed remuneration in line with suggestion G.18 of the GCGC.\\nFixed remuneration strengthens the independence of the Super-\\nvisory Board in advising and monitoring the Board of Manage-\\nment. The structure and amount of the fixed remuneration\\nshould ensure that highly qualified individuals can be proposed\\nto the Annual General Meeting for membership of the Supervi-\\nsory Board. This promotes the quality of advice and oversight,\\nwhich contributes to the Company’s sustainable and long -term\\ndevelopment.\\nIn accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, each member of \\nthe Supervisory Board of BMW  AG who does not exercise any \\nadditional function relevant to remuneration receives fixed remu-\\nneration of € 200,000 p.a. \\nThe GCGC recommends that exercising the functions of the chair \\nand deputy chair of the Supervisory Board should also be con-\\nsidered when determining the level of remuneration, along with \\nany committees an individual chairs or sits on (Suggestion G.17). \\nThis is to take account of the extra time commitment associated \\nwith these positions. The Articles of Incorporation of BMW AG \\nalso take account of the requirements for the Audit Committee \\nand its Chairman. They stipulate that the Chairman of the Super-\\nvisory Board shall receive three times the amount, and each \\nDeputy Chairman twice the amount, of remuneration paid to a \\nSupervisory Board member who has no additional remunera-\\ntion-relevant functions. The Chair of the Audit Committee re-\\nceives two-and-a-quarter times the amount, the Chairs of other \\nSupervisory Board committees twice the amount, each member \\nof the Audit Committee twice the amount, and each member of \\nanother committee one-and-a-half times the amount of the re-\\nmuneration paid to a Supervisory Board member, provided the \\nrelevant committee convened on at least three days during the \\nfinancial year. If a member of the Supervisory Board exercises \\nmore than one of the functions referred to above, their remuner-\\nation is measured only on the basis of the function receiving the \\nhighest amount. \\nIn the event of changes in the composition of the Supervisor y \\nBoard during the year, or if additional remuneration -relevant \\nfunctions are performed, remuneration is calculated on a propor-\\ntionate basis. \\nIn addition, each member of the Supervisory Board receives an \\nattendance fee of € 2,000 per meeting for each meeting of the \\nSupervisory Board (plenary) in which he or she participates. This \\nalso applies to participation by telephone or video link. If they at-\\ntend more than one meeting on the same day, the meetings are \\nnot remunerated separately. A continuous session on two con-\\nsecutive days is treated as one session. \\nThe remuneration and the attendance fee are only paid after the \\nend of the respective financial year. Furthermore, the company \\nreimburses each member of the Supervisory Board for their rea-\\nsonable expenses. In order to be able to perform his duties, the \\nChairman of the Supervisory Board is provided with secretariat \\nand chauffeur services. \\n3. Remuneration granted and owed to members of the \\nSupervisory Board pursuant to § 162 of the German Stock Cor-\\nporation Act (AktG) \\nThe following table shows the remuneration granted and owed \\nto the members of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial \\nyear in accordance with § 162 (1) Sentence 1 German Stock \\nCorporation Act (AktG). The activity on which the remuneration \\nfor the 2023 financial year is based was fully performed by the \\nbalance sheet date. Therefore, the remuneration for the Super-\\nvisory Board activities is classified as granted for the 2023 finan-\\ncial year, even if the payment of the Supervisory Board remuner-\\nation (including the attendance fee) was made after the end of \\nthe 2023 financial year.  \\nOverview of remuneration of the members of the \\nSupervisory Board¹ \\nFactor Amount in € p. a.3 \\nMember of Supervisory Board 1.00 200,000 \\nChairman Supervisory Board 3.00 600,000 \\nDeputy Chairman Supervisory Board  2.00 400,000 \\nChairman of the Audit Committee2 2.25 450,000 \\nChairman of other committee2 2.00 400,000 \\nMember of the Audit Committee2 2.00 400,000 \\nMember of other committee2 1.50 300,000 \\n1 If a Supervisory Board member performs more than one of the functions referred to above, their \\nremuneration is measured only on the basis of the function that is remunerated with the highest \\namount. \\n2 Provided that the Committee has met on at least three days during the financial year. \\n3 Plus attendance fee of € 2,000 per plenary session.

The remuneration granted and owed to former \\nmembers of the Board of Management includes any variable re-\\nmuneration from previous vesting years and any remuneration \\nfrom any contracts of employment that remained valid beyond \\nthe end of their mandate, as well as retirement benefit plans \\n(pension payments, payments from the retirement capital ac-\\ncount), fringe benefits and any waiting allowances paid. \\nThe change in earnings is presented on the basis of BMW AG’s \\nnet profit for the year in accordance with the German Commercial \\nCode (HGB). In addition, the changes in the key indicators “earn-\\nings attributable to shareholders of BMW AG” and “Group return \\non sales after tax” are reported, as these key indicators are rele-\\nvant for both the calculation of the variable remuneration of the \\nmembers of the Board of Management (earnings component of \\nthe bonus) and the performance -related remuneration of man-\\nagers and employees. \\nThe presentation of average employee remuneration is based on \\nthe average remuneration of all employees of BMW AG on a full-\\ntime equivalent basis. In the 2023 financial year, this was \\n83,383 people. Worldwide, the BMW Group employed 154,950 \\npeople at 31 December 2023. In order to calculate the average \\nemployee remuneration presented, the principles applicable to \\nthe calculation of the remuneration granted and owed to the \\nmembers of the Board of Management and the Supervisory \\nBoard pursuant to § 162 (1) Sentence 1 AktG were applied \\naccordingly.

AUDITOR’S REPORT  \\nTo Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, München \\nWe have audited the remuneration report of Bayerische Motoren \\nWerke Aktiengesellschaft, München, for the financial year from \\nJanuary 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 including the related \\ndisclosures, which was prepared to comply with § [Article] 162 \\nAktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act]. \\nResponsibilities of the Executive Directors and the \\nSupervisory Board \\nThe executive directors and the supervisory board of Bayerische \\nMotoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the prep-\\naration of the remuneration report, including the related disclo -\\nsures, that complies with the requirements of § 162 AktG. The \\nexecutive directors and the supervisory board are also responsi-\\nble for such internal control as they determine is necessary to \\nenable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the re-\\nlated disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud or error. \\nAuditor’s Responsibilities  \\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration \\nreport, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We \\nconducted our audit in accordance with German generally ac-\\ncepted standards for the audit of financial statements promul-\\ngated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Au-\\nditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we com-\\nply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration \\nreport, including the related disclosures, is free from material \\nmisstatement.  \\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence \\nabout the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the \\nremuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the au-\\nditor's judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of \\nmaterial misstatement of the remuneration report including the \\nrelated disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. \\nIn making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal \\ncontrol relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report in-\\ncluding the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan \\nand perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-\\nstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \\neffectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also in-\\ncludes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies \\nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by \\nthe executive directors and the supervisory board, as well as \\nevaluating the overall presentation of remuneration report in-\\ncluding the related disclosures. \\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient \\nand appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. \\nAudit Opinion  \\nIn our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remunera-\\ntion report for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to Decem-\\nber 31 2023, including the related disclosures, complies in all \\nmaterial respects with the accounting provisions of § 162 AktG. \\nReference to an Other Matter – Formal Audit of the \\nRemuneration Report according to § 162 AktG \\nThe audit of the content of the remuneration report described in \\nthis auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remuneration \\nreport required by § 162 Abs. [paragraph] 3 AktG, including the \\nissuance of a report on this audit. As we express an unqualified \\naudit opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this audit \\nopinion includes that the information required by § 162 Abs. 1 \\nand 2 AktG has been disclosed in all material respects in the re-\\nmuneration report. \\nRestriction on use \\nWe issue this auditor’s report on the basis of the engagement \\nagreed with Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft. The \\naudit has been performed only for purposes of the company and \\nthe auditor‘s report is solely intended to inform the company as \\nto the results of the audit. Our responsibility for the audit and for \\nour auditor’s report is only towards the company in accordance \\nwith this engagement. The auditor’s report is not intended for \\nany third parties to base any (financial) decisions thereon. We do \\nnot assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards \\nthird parties; no third parties are included in the scope of protec-\\ntion of the underlying engagement. § 334 BGB [Bürgerliches \\nGesetzbuch: German Civil Code], according to which objections \\narising from a contract may also be raised against third parties, \\nis not waived. \\nMunich, March 14, 2024 \\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH \\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft \\nPetra Justenhoven Michael Popp \\nWirtschaftsprüferin Wirtschaftsprüfer \\n(German Public Auditor) (German Public Auditor) \\n \"),\n",

The methodology used to calculate CO2 emissions changed in the reporting year 2023 for the items “Purchased Goods and services” and “Logistics – material supply of the plants and \\ndistribution of vehicles”. The prior-year figures have been adjusted retrospectively. \\n2 Carbon emissions (excluding climate-impacting gases other than carbon dioxide) generated by vehicle production (BMW Group plants and BMW Motorcycle, excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) and by other BMW Group locations not directly related to production (e.g. research centres, sales \\ncentres, office buildings). \\n3 This amount includes 15,881 t CO2 from the direct use of biomass. \\n4 Calculation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, using the operational control approach in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Leased space without the direct influence of the BMW Group on energy supply is therefore not included. \\n5 Includes the emissions of company cars and function-related vehicles of the BMW Group plants, as well as the 12 major markets. Emissions are preferably calculated on the basis of tank refills. This is the case for the plants and/or markets in Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy \\n(only Alphabet Italia S.p.A. and BMW Bank GmbH, Milan), Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea (only BMW Financial Services Korea Co., Ltd., Seoul), Thailand and the UK. In the remaining cases, they are determined based on kilometres driven. For the USA, the data are partly extrapolated for 2023 \\nbecause the information was not yet available for the entire period at the time the data was collected. For BMW Italia S.p.A. and BMW Italia Retail S.r.l., values for the reporting period are calculated based on average kilometres per day. For system-related reasons, the refuelling of company vehicles includes \\nboth business and private trips, except refuelling paid for by employees themselves. \\n6 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also included on a pro-rata basis under employee commuting and use phase (both Scope 3). A distinction in the systems is currently not possible. \\n7 The increase in this metric is the result of the scope being increased as compared to the previous year. Reporting was only submitted for Germany and the international test sites up to and including 2022. During the 2023 reporting year, all BMW Group plants and the 12 major markets were integrated into the \\nfigure. A calculation based on the Scope from 2022 results in a comparative value for 2023 of 80,869 t CO2 (+5.7% compared to previous year). No retrospective adjustment was made. As a result, the figures for 2023 are not directly comparable with previous years. \\n8 As a result of the extensive travel restrictions in place during the pandemic, 2019 is used as a base year for more meaningful comparisons in terms of civil aviation. \\n9 Scope 2 emissions calculated using the market-based method in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance; mainly based on the emissions factors for electricity, district heating and fuels reported by the VDA (each in the latest version dated 12/2023) and occasionally using local emissions factors; \\nalternative calculation using the location-based method: 1,195,818 t CO2. \\nFURTHER GRI INFORMATION  \\nin t CO2  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023 \\nTotal emissions1  147,257,699  132,064,779  137,592,164  130,743,357  134,699,641 \\nSCOPE 1: DIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS            \\nTotal emissions  678,403  678,967  699,713  694,057  713,933 \\nBMW Group locations2, 3, 4   586,638  604,620  631,304  614,117  595,257 \\nCompany vehicles5, 6, 7   85,667  72,554  66,442  76,491  113,431 \\nCompany-owned planes8  6,098  1,793  1,967  3,449  5,245 \\nSCOPE 2: INDIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS            \\nTotal emissions  354,095  130,090  134,849  91,300  110,141 \\nElectricity/heat purchased by BMW Group locations 2, 4, 9   354,095  130,090  134,849  91,300  110,141 '),\n",

A distinction in the systems is currently not possible. \\n5 2019 is not directly comparable to the other years because an improved data basis was available from 2020 onwards. In some cases, figures have been extrapolated based on data collected at major national and international BMW Group locations. The sites in Farnborough, UK, and Woodcliff Lake, USA, \\nwere included in the calculation for the first time in the reporting year 2023. \\n6 The methodology used to calculate carbon emissions changed in the 2023 reporting year. Previously, the CO2e values were calculated on the basis of a small set of TÜV-validated life cycle assessments performed for European vehicles. Enhancements to the IT system have made it possible to perform a \\ndifferentiated calculation for all vehicles taking into account different energy mixes and carbon emission factors for different production regions (see ↗ Glossary). The values in the time series were adapted using this new methodology (values based on prior methodology: 2019: 18,505,921 t CO2e, 2020: \\n16,234,959 t CO2e, 2021: 18,534,765 t CO2e, 2022: 19,758,702 t CO2e). The values for 2019 through 2021 as well as 2023 shown in the table according to the new methodology were subjected to a reasonable assurance audit. The carbon-reducing measures are taken into account from 2022 onwards.  \\nThe implementation of measures for 2022 was subjected to a limited assurance audit. \\n7 Energy consumption values (lower calorific value) in the “Purchased goods and services” category and the “Disposal” category are estimated using the methodology specified in footnote (9): 113,179 GWh in the “Purchased goods and services” category and 908 GWh in the “Disposal” category. \\n8 The absolute emissions in the use phase are based on the ↗ Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet worldwide, including upstream emissions (Scope 3 downstream, well-to-wheel). The total value in t CO2 is the result of multiplying the average value with all BMW Group vehicles sold in the reporting period \\nand an assumed average mileage of 200,000 km (as per VDA 900-100). \\n9 CO2e calculated based on life cycle assessments as per ISO 14040/44 of representative vehicles from the product lines using the “LCA for Experts” tool provided by Sphera (including climate-impacting gases CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, NF3).

In this context, the \\nBMW Group has set itself decarbonisation targets by 2030 (base \\nyear 2019) during the usephase, in the upstream supply chain \\nand in production. These have been registered with the SBTi and \\nvalidated (↗ Reducing carbon emissions across the entire value \\nchain). The BMW Group is also taking measures to mitigate and \\nadapt to climate change. It is therefore imperative to identify \\nclimate-related risks and opportunities and to take appropriate \\naccount of them in determining the strategic direction to be \\nfollowed, managing the business and organising a Group -wide \\nrisk management system. For further information, see  ↗ Climate-\\nrelated Risks and Opportunities.

This includes activities that avoid or reduce greenhouse \\ngas emissions as well as those that remove greenhouse gases \\nfrom the atmosphere and store them. BVCM is strongly recom-\\nmended by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to vali-\\ndated companies in addition to CO2 reduction in their own value \\nchain. The BMW Group is committed to this reduction hierarchy \\nand already actively manages both direct and indirect carbon \\nemissions from its plants in line with the 1.5°C pathway set by \\nthe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which involves im-\\nplementing significant measures in our value chain, plus addi-\\ntionally engaging in BVCM to address emissions outside our own \\nvalue chain. We voluntarily back these initiatives without them \\ncounting towards the BMW Group’s CO2 reduction targets. \\nBVCM involves, for example, purchasing certificates on the vol-\\nuntary carbon market. Criteria such as additionality, perma-\\nnence, and certification by independent institutions following in-\\nternational standards (Gold Standard) contribute to the quality of \\nthe certificates employed, thereby bolstering the efficacy of our \\ncommitment beyond our internal value chain. \\nIt is also important to us that projects in the Global South create \\na social benefit in line with the Sustainable Development Goals \\n(SDGs). These include, for example, initiatives that create health \\nbenefits such as avoiding open fires in enclosed spaces. \\nBond \\nA securitised debt instrument in which the issuer certifies its ob-\\nligation to repay the nominal amount at the end of a fixed term \\nand to pay a fixed or variable rate of interest. \\nBusiness volume in balance sheet terms \\nThe sum of the balance sheet line items “Leased products” and \\n“Receivables from sales financing” (current and non-current), as \\nreported in the balance sheet for the Financial Services segment. \\nC \\nCapitalisation rate \\nCapitalised development costs as a percentage of research and \\ndevelopment expenditure. \\nCapital expenditure ratio (excluding capitalised \\ndevelopment costs) \\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment and other intangi-\\nble assets (excluding capitalised development costs) as a per-\\ncentage of Group turnover. \\nCapital expenditure ratio (excluding right-of-use assets and \\ncapitalised development costs) \\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment (excluding right-\\nof-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16) and other intangible \\nassets (excluding capitalised development costs ) as a percent-\\nage of Group turnover. \\nCarbon dioxide equivalents/CO2e \\nCO2e is a unit of measurement used to standardise the climate \\nimpact of various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as me-\\nthane or nitrous oxide. This is necessary because the individual \\ngases do not all contribute equally to the greenhouse effect. In \\naddition, the expert committee at the United Nations (Intergov-\\nernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) has defined “global \\nwarming potential” (GWP). This is an index used to express \\nwarming impact compared with CO2 so that all GHGs are aggre-\\ngated. For example, over a period of 100 years, methane has 28 \\ntimes the impact of CO2, while for nitrous oxide the impact is 265 \\ntimes higher. \\nCarbon emissions in the supply chain, including in transport lo-\\ngistics, as well as in upstream fuel production (well- to-tank) are \\nreferred to as CO2e.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership \\nbetween the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Busi-\\nness Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), distin-\\nguishes between Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, \\nbased on their various sources. Whereas direct emissions (Scope \\n1) are generated within a company through the combustion of \\nfossil fuels, Scope 2 refers to the indirect emissions caused by \\nthe consumption of electricity and heat from externally generated \\nsources of energy. Additional indirect (Scope 3) emissions are \\ngenerated in the upstream and downstream stages of the value \\nchain, for instance in the supply chain (upstream) and in the sub-\\nsequent use of products and services (downstream). \\nCarbon emissions from BMW Group locations per vehicle \\nproduced (Scope 1 and 2) \\nThis key indicator is calculated from the direct and indirect car-\\nbon emissions of BMW Group locations relating to the number of \\nvehicles produced during the year under report. The carbon \\nemissions result from energy consumption in the BMW Group \\nplants as well as non-manufacturing sites. Electricity from on -\\nsite renewable generation, Power Purchase Agreements for \\ngreen electricity and Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g. guaran-\\ntees of origin) are all taken into account. The conversion is based \\non emission factors for electricity, district heating and fuels from \\nthe German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) in the \\nmost current v alid version and occasionally local emission fac-\\ntors. This key indicator is the basis for measuring the strategic \\ntarget by 2030 with regard to Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The re-\\nporting indicator is t CO2 per vehicle produced. \\nCO2e emissions from the supply chain including transport \\nlogistics per vehicle produced (Scope 3 upstream) \\nA methodology tailored specifically for BMW was created to as-\\nsess the supply chain and logistics emissions in terms of their \\nCO2e equivalents. Due to the absence of supplier -specific CO2e \\nvalues throughout the entire supply chain, a model incorporating \\nindustry averages and, when accessible, supplier-specific data is \\nused. This method draws upon components of ISO 14040/44 \\nand follows common practice in preparing life cycle analyses \\n(LCA). However, it should be noted that this approach may not \\nbe directly comparable with methods or values employed by \\nother companies. Due to a lack of data availability, various esti-\\nmates, assumptions and average values are used to determine \\nthe key indicator. The aim is to improve the quality of the model \\nfor calculating key metrics in future years. This will be achieved \\nby boosting transparency in supply chains and expanding the de-\\ntail of the model, all while maintaining consistency in calculations \\nover time. \\nThe indicator quantifies greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2e) pro-\\nduced during production (GHG Protocol Scope 3 upstream cate-\\ngory 1), including the transportation of purchased goods and ser-\\nvices for production (“inbound”), as well as the global vehicle dis-\\ntribution of BMW Group automobiles (“outbound”) (collectively \\nGHG Protocol Scope 3 upstream category 4). Contrary to the def-\\ninition of the scopes of the GHG Protocol, the following are not \\nincluded: motorcycles, racing vehicles and aftersales products, \\nincluding their transport logistics, as well as purchased IT cloud \\nservices and engineering or development services. \\nBaseline calculation of supply chain emissions \\nThe initial calculation of the supply chain CO 2e emissions for a \\nrepresentative selection of vehicles is based on their bill of mate-\\nrials. This selection reflects the range of vehicle classes (from \\npremium compact to luxury) and types of drive (petrol, diesel, \\nPHEV and BEV) produced during the period under review. \\nFor the representati ve vehicles, the CO 2e emissions of all in-\\nstalled components are calculated on the basis of their material \\ncomposition and related processing steps. Up to around 60,000 \\nindividual entries are evaluated in each case. The CO2e value of \\nthe relevant vehicle is  calculated by adding these contributions \\ntogether. \\nFor the vast majority of vehicle models produced that are not in-\\ncluded in the representative vehicles, there is no individual CO2e \\ncalculation available on a bill of materials basis. A modular scal-\\ning calculation method has been developed to include these in \\nthe overall result: \\nThe bill of materials of the representative vehicles is divided into \\nsections (modules) according to functional criteria, and these are \\nassessed in terms of their total CO2e emissions. Previously un-\\nassessed vehicle derivatives can now be custom -built using \\nthese basic components, with different building blocks selected \\nbased on the specific technical features of the target vehicles, in-\\ncluding engine type, all-wheel drive or body style. Components \\nthat do not fit are scaled from existing ones. The scaling tech-\\nniques are based on empirical data derived from similar analyses \\nas well as on expert evaluations. This encompasses the scaling \\nof detailed bodywork calculations ranging from sedans to touring \\nmodels with identical engine specifications. \\nFor example, in the baseline calculation for 2023, there is a 520i \\nlisted as a bill of materials vehicle, but no 520i Touring. To en-\\nsure that the latter is accurately represented, the calculated CO2e \\nemissions for components like the drivetrain, wheels, seats and \\nso on remain unchanged, while the body values are multiplied by \\na scaling factor when calculating the Touring model. \\nThe methodology outlined above depends on the established \\n“LCA for Experts” database (previously known as “GaBi”) from \\nSphera to ascertain CO 2e factors for energy, raw materials and \\nmanufacturing processes. In this process, the current datasets \\nare consistently used, starting with the 2023 reporting year. Ret-\\nrospectively from 2019 until the release of the current datasets \\nat the end of February 2023, data from 2019 are used to calcu-\\nlate CO2e emissions. \\nThe CO2e emissions of supply chains vary across different re-\\ngions of the world. For this reason, we allocate the productio n \\nsites of the vehicles to one of three regions: Europe, Asia or the \\nUSA. We then calculate the emissions for the entire vehicle sup-\\nply chain using the Sphera datasets that are valid for that region. \\nThe particularly emission-intensive components, battery cells \\nand catalytic converter coating are specifically calculated based \\non their actual production region, regardless of the vehicle’s \\nmanufacturing location. \\nGiven the significant impact of battery cell production on the ve-\\nhicles’ total CO2e emissions, a detailed calculation model is used '),\n",

In addition to the actual assembly sites of the \\nbattery cells, the material compositions and related production \\nprocesses, it also accounts for the unique characteristics of the \\ncell chemistry (anode and cathode) as well as the emissions as-\\nsociated with supplier-specific energy consumption. \\nThis approach gives each vehicle built during the period under \\nreview its specific CO2e value for supply chain emissions. The to-\\ntal fleet value of CO 2e supply chain  emissions is calculated by \\nadding up the CO2e contributions of all vehicles produced in the \\nreporting year. \\nShare of the reported value attributable to the supply chain \\nThe reduction in CO2e emissions compared to the BMW Group’s \\nbaseline is the result of emission-reducing measures in the sup-\\nply chain that were contractually agreed with suppliers and veri-\\nfiably implemented during the reporting year (e.g. electricity from \\nrenewable sources, use of recycled materials). Agreements with \\nsuppliers of aluminium and precious metals as well as high-volt-\\nage storage cells resulted in particularly high reduction contribu-\\ntions. \\nThe CO2e value for these components and materials before the \\nimplementation of measures is initially determined using the \\n“LCA for Experts” database on the basis of the type and quantity \\nof material. The emission-reducing measures are then deducted. \\nThe calculation of the effect is also carried out using industry av-\\nerage values from “LCA for Experts” for green electricity and sec-\\nondary raw materials. \\nThe total emission- reducing measures for all components and \\nraw materials in the vehicles produced in the reporting year that \\nare evaluated in this manner is subtracted from the baseline \\nvalue. This results in the share of supply chain CO2e emissions in \\nthe reporting value of the overall indicator. The methodology for \\ncalculating the supply chain CO2e emissions outlined above \\nmarks a key improvement over the previous approach. This im-\\nprovement allows for the inclusion of agreed-upon emission-re-\\nducing measures at the level of individual components and raw \\nmaterials, among other factors. Until 2022, each vehicle in the \\nfleet was allocated the supply chain CO2e value of the most sim-\\nilar vehicle from a small selection of vehicles that already had \\nTÜV-validated life cycle assessments available. The reporting \\nmetric is then obtained by adding the transport logistics CO 2e \\nemissions, the calculation of which is described in the following \\nsection. \\nAn external service provider commissioned by BMW conducts \\nthe verification of measures at affected suppliers and their sub-\\ncontractors at the impacted manufacturing sites. A defined \\nmethod is used to ensure that the contractually agreed emis-\\nsions-reducing measures are implemented clearly and without \\nduplication in the reporting year. There are some limitations re-\\ngarding the clear and non -repetitive allocation of material flows \\nwith secondary raw materials. Due to the lack of regulatory man-\\ndates, there is currently neither a requirement for the recording \\nand documentation of material flows for secondary materials \\nacross the supply chain (for example on delivery notes), nor is \\nthere a government-operated/regulatory registry similar to that \\nof green energy certificates that facilitates the distinct allocation \\nof secondary materials to specific customers without duplication. \\nTherefore, the secondary material quota is confirmed using sys-\\ntem extracts from the relevant suppliers’ Enterprise Resource \\nPlanning (ERP) systems, along with details and evidence of sec-\\nondary material procurement through mass balances. Further-\\nmore, written confirmation is obtained from suppliers and n-tier \\nsuppliers (via declarations of conformity) to clearly attribute sec-\\nondary materials to BMW products, preventing any possibility of \\ndouble-counting with other customers. \\nTransport logistics’ share of the reporting value \\nThis indicator takes into account transport logistics emissions in \\nthe reporting year. Firstly, inbound and outbound transport flows \\nare documented using IT-enabled billing and movement data to \\ncalculate the CO2e emissions in tonnes and the transport volume \\nin tonne-kilometres. \\nIn inbound logistics (production supply), all transport flows of in-\\ndividual component parts for automobile manufacturing (BMW, \\nMINI and Rolls Royce) are considered. This includes \\ntransportation from the Tier 1 supplier’s shipping location to the \\nreceipt of goods at individual production plants worldwide, in-\\ncluding partner plants and excluding contract manufacturing \\nsites. In outbound logistics (vehicle distribution), all transport \\nflows of new vehicles transported from the production sites \\nthrough compounds and national distributors to individual deal-\\nerships worldwide are considered. Exceptions include partial vol-\\numes from partner plants. \\nCO2e emissions are calculated for the gross weight (component \\nweight including packaging and shipping material) as well as the \\nspecific vehicle weight and the distance travelled in kilometres. \\nThis calculation is based on the respective CO2e emission factor, \\nwhich varies depending on the technology and mode of transport \\n(road, sea, rail or air). The CO2e emission factors used are de-\\nrived from contemporary standards such as the GLEC Frame-\\nwork V3.0 and ISO 14083, supplemented by supplier-specific \\nvalues whenever possible. \\nIn a second step, an  average, derivative-specific inbound CO 2e \\nvalue is assigned to each vehicle produced from the CO 2e as-\\nsessed transport flows, based on plant location and type of drive, \\nand an outbound CO2e value is assigned based on the factory -\\nmarket relationship. If inbound and/or outbound CO2e values for \\nindividual derivatives are missing in the recorded transport \\nstreams (step 1), these are supplemented on the basis of exist-\\ning derivatives with similar transport routes. Consequently, each \\nmanufactured vehicle is allocated an inbound and outbound \\nCO2e factor based on the production site and intended market. \\nThe share of CO 2e emissions attributed to transport logistics \\nwithin the “supply chain and logistics emissions” metric is deter-\\nmined by aggregating the inbound and outbound CO 2e emis-\\nsions of all vehicles manufactured in the reporting year. This ap-\\nproach applies to the CO2e contributions from transport logistics \\nin the base year and in 2022.  \\nCO2e emissions for the years 2019 to 2021 were calculated in \\nprevious corporate reports using a variety of emissions factors. \\nBetween 2019 and 2022, the recording or assessment of CO2e \\nfrom transport movements was consistently improved. Among \\nother things, a new IT system was introduced in 2022 to expand '),\n",

In \\nline with the range of factors and data sources used for emis-\\nsions from 2022 onward, a retrospective assessment of \\ntransport logistics emissions is carried out for the years 2019 to \\n2021, following the same methodology as from 2022 onward. \\nThis involves using factory- or market-specific inbound and out-\\nbound CO2e emissions data from 2022 for the vehicles produced \\nin each corresponding year. Vehicle variants from 2019 to 2021 \\nthat are no longer produced in 2022 will be supplemented on the \\nbasis of existing derivatives with similar transport routes. \\nCarbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet in the EU (Scope 3 \\ndownstream, tank-to-wheel) \\nThe average carbon emissions of a manufacturer’s fleet (use \\nphase) are calculated on the basis of the weighted average of \\ncarbon emissions across all vehicles newly registered during the \\nreporting period. This is based on the volume of new registra-\\ntions by a manufacturer in the EU, including Norway and Iceland, \\nin the calendar year and the individual vehicle -specific carbon \\nemissions determined in accordance with the WLTP type test \\nprocedure. The BMW Group’s fleet carbon emissions figure, as \\nmeasured internally, includes a legally permitted allowance for \\neco-innovations with mi nor significance. The performance indi-\\ncator for reporting purposes is g CO2 per kilometre driven. \\nCarbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet worldwide \\nincluding upstream emissions (Scope 3 downstream, well-\\nto-wheel) \\nThis indicator documents the progress made by the BMW Group \\nin its strategic objective of reducing carbon emissions during the \\nuse phase including upstream emissions (drivetrain energy sup-\\nply) by an average rate of at least 50% per kilometre driven by \\n2030 (base year 2019). For the purpose of this calculation, vol-\\nume-weighted average fleet carbon emissions are calculated for \\nthe core markets EU (27 EU countries including Norway and Ice-\\nland plus UK) (driving cycle: Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehi-\\ncles Test Procedure; basis: vehicle registrations), USA (driving \\ncycle: United States Combined; basis: production volume) and \\nChina (driving cycle: Worldwide Harmonized Test Cycle, subject \\nto China-specific framework conditions for testing; basis: import \\nor local production volumes) before deduction of legal ly \\npermitted credit factors (e.g. supercredits and eco -innovations) \\nand standardised according to the WLTP (European) driving cy-\\ncle. These core markets account for more than 80% of the BMW \\nGroup’s sales. The calculated figures are increased by 10% to \\naccount for possible discrepancies between cycle values and real \\nemissions, as required by the Science Based Targets initiative. \\nThis indicator also includes the upstream emissions of the en-\\nergy sources (fossil fuels and electricity used for charging), in line \\nwith the well-to-wheel approach. This covers the entire impact \\nchain behind vehicle motion, i.e. from the generation and supply \\nof power to its conversion into drivetrain energy. This approach \\nalso includes the environmental impacts associated with the pro-\\nduction of fuel and electricity. For example, to calculate the vol-\\nume of emissions resulting from upstream electricity (drivetrain \\nenergy supply), the BMW Group uses the energy report pub-\\nlished by the International Energy Agency (IEA; reference basis: \\nprevious year) as a basis in order to assess the emissions asso-\\nciated with the electricity mix in its core markets. The perfor-\\nmance indicator for reporting purposes is g CO2 per kilometre \\ndriven. \\nCash flow at risk \\nSimilar to “value at risk” (see definition below). \\nCash flow hedges \\nHedges against exposures to the variability in forecasted cash \\nflows, particularly in connection with exchange rate fluctuations. \\nCommercial paper \\nDeep-discounted bonds with a term of less than one year. \\nConsolidation \\nThe process of consolidating separate financial statements of \\nGroup entities into Group Financial Statements, depicting the fi-\\nnancial position, net assets and results of operations of the \\nGroup as a single economic entity. \\nCredit default swap (CDS) \\nFinancial swap agreements, under which creditors of securities \\n(usually bonds) pay premiums to the seller of the CDS to hedge \\nagainst the risk that the issuer of the bond will default. As with \\ncredit default insurance agreements, the party receiving the pre-\\nmiums gives a commitment to compensate the bond creditor in \\nthe event of default. \\nD \\nDeliveries \\nA new or used vehicle will be recorded as a delivery once handed \\nover to the end user. End users also include leaseholders under \\nlease contracts with BMW Financial Services and – in the US and \\nCanada – dealerships when they designate a vehicle as a service \\nloaner or demonstrator vehicle. In the case of used vehicles, end \\nusers may include dealerships and other third parties when they \\npurchase a vehicle at auction or directly from the BMW Group. \\nVehicles designated for the end user which suffer a total loss in \\ntransit are also recorded as deliveries. Deliveries may be made \\nby BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group \\nretail outlet, or independent dealerships. The vast majority of de-\\nliveries – and hence the reporting to BMW Group of deliveries – \\nare made by independent dealerships. In the US and Canada, \\nthe period start and end dates for the reporting of deliveries de-\\nviate immaterially from the beginning and, respectively, end of \\ncalendar years or calendar quarters and instead follow industry-\\nstandard reporting calendars.
