# Generative AI in Risk and Finance

## Course Overview

The **Generative AI in Risk and Finance** course aims to provide participants with practical skills in applying Generative AI (GenAI) to quantitative risk management. This hands-on seminar covers various methods and use cases which bear great potential for innovation to professionals in the Risk and Finance sector.

## Key Learning Objectives

Participants will explore the cutting-edge field of Generative AI (GenAI) and its applications in risk analytics. The course will cover:
- Introduction to **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models** (LLMs)
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG)
- The concept of **agents**

By the end of the seminar, participants will have a working understanding of how to leverage GenAI, LLMs, and RAG to create advanced tools for risk management and decision-making using popular Python frameworks such as **LlamaIndex**, **LangChain** and **LangGraph**.

## Practical Application

A specific use case explored in the course involves building a Multi-Document Risk Agent, a conversational AI system that allows users to interact with and extract insights from annual reports of publicly listed companies. The goal is to demonstrate how GenAI can enhance the seamless access to information for professionals in the field and should show the innovative capacity of the technology.
