# Advanced Risk Analytics in Python

## Overview
This repository hosts the source code of the **Advanced Risk Analytics in Python** course! The course is designed to equip participants with practical skills and knowledge in the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) within the context of quantitative risk management. As a hands-on cource, the course will cover a range of methods and use cases relevant to risk assessment and management in the financial services and insurance industries.

## Course Structure

### Part 1: Introduction to Concepts and Methods

#### Day 1: Machine Learning and Risk Modelling
Participants will learn key ML concepts and algorithms, including:
- **ML pipelines**
- **Tree-based ML algorithms** (e.g., Regression Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- **Model training and model inference**

The focus will be on practical programming exercises that assess credit and market risks using popular Python libraries such as **scikit-learn** and **pandas**. The goal is to understand how machine learning can add value in quantitatively assess risks that organizations operating under uncertainty are facing.

#### Day 2: Natural Language Processing and Risk Assessment
This session will cover NLP techniques relevant to the insurance sector, including:
- **Text Vectorization** (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- **Text Classification**
- **Semantic Search**

Participants will explore how these techniques can enhance policy processing and risk assessment of claims in the insurance industry.

### Part 2: Take-Home Assignment
After the introductory sessions, participants will work on a practical problem from the insurance industry using public claims data. They will apply the methods learned to evaluate whether and under what constraints the problem can be solved. Participants will have **2-4 weeks** to complete this assignment and will present their findings in a **short presentation** during a follow-up session lasting **1-2 days** (depending on the number of participants).

## Materials and Resources
All course materials will be provided via GitHub. Prior to the seminar, participants will receive introductory slides explaining Git and GitHub, along with setup instructions to ensure everyone is well-prepared and can seamlessly engage with the course content.

## Prerequisites
Participants should have **sound knowledge of Python programming**. This foundational skill is crucial for effectively following the course materials. Prior to enrollment of the course, students will get access to a short Python quiz which they can use as a self-assessment for their level of Python knowledge. It is generally recommended to enroll in the course only if you felt comfortable doing the quiz. Otherwise it is likely that you have a hard time following the course material.
