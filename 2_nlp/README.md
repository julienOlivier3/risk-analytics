# Natural Language Processing in Risk and Finance

## Course Overview

The **Natural Language Processing and Finance** course aims to provide participants with practical skills in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to quantitative risk management. This hands-on seminar covers various techniques and use cases relevant to professionals in the Risk and Finance sectors that need to handle unstructured data.

## Key Learning Objectives

Participants will learn essential NLP techniques and their evolution in recent years, including:
- **Text Vectorization** (e.g., tf-idf, word embeddings)
- **Text Clustering** via topic modeling

The course emphasizes a systematic approach to processing and assessing textual data, utilizing popular Python libraries like **sentence_transformers** and **bertopic**.

## Practical Application

A specific use case explored in the course involves assessing insurance claims, a request made by a policyholder to their insurance company for compensation or coverage after a covered loss or damage. The goal is to demonstrate how NLP methods can automate the processing of claims streamlining manual processes.
